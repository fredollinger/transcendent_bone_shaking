  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I have been wanting, for a long time, to get involved in cycling activism. My ideas on this finally caught fire when I attended the first meeting to make Critical Mass safer and more enjoyable for cyclists, pedestrians, and motorists.

Below are some notes from the meeting:

9/21/2009

1.There's a web site for critical mass on myspace: http://www.myspace.com/criticalmassride
2.Bad idea to go on Coronado Bridge
- someone could fall
- not in the interest of advocacy or critical mass
- could spur crackdown like in NYC
- tasers were deployed when people tried to recross bridge

3.Perhaps CM could be used to petition to open the bridge.
- Not part of actual CM, could petition at fountain
- bridge is last part of Bay Shore Bikeway

4. What you do on CM represents all cyclists.

5. Crasher, in the Reader, threatened riders: http://74.125.155.132/search?q=cache:FaiufUjIemkJ:www.sandiegoreader.com/weblogs/daily-crasher/2009/aug/29/bicyclists-and-poditrists/+crasher+critical+mass+san+diego+reader&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us

6. Need creative ways to advocate safety
- critical mass safety guide online
- peace patrol – positive -retro
- goal #1 stop people from getting hit by motorists

7. Last ride a rider hit a pedestrian at Centre Street in Hillcrest. They were both hospitalized.

8. corking
- communicate with motorist
- thank them for waiting
- sometimes it's better to let them through
- WARN other cyclists if the motorist is going to drive through, but get out of the way

9. circling
- shouldn't be aggressive
- should be used sparingly

10. police
- more or less invovement?
- Don't wish to be co-opted
- police bike patrol involvement?
- Bike officers rejected writing on bike blog; police don't do advocacy

11. speed
- some people go too fast at start which breaks up the mass
- vetren riders are left out—no leadership
- liquor store stops to slow things down—don't stay too long, ride loses momentum
- circling is not the answer

12.information distribution
- flyer on internet
- comics are easier to understand and read
- need to make flyer valuable and entertaining
- sdbikecommuter
- flyering campus
- map back to the park
- list of places to go to and to NEVER go to
- “Do you have health insurance?” as a hook

13. listserv

14. bike kitchen 9 AM – 1 PM Saturday at 43rd and Whitman

15. petition ideas
- Balboa bridge is costly and not high priority
- Sharrows
- Center City/City Heights East of 805 needs more infrastructure-]]></content:encoded>

  <title>The Reader's Article</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- 		@page { size: 8.5in 11in; margin: 0.79in } 		P { margin-bottom: 0.08in } -->
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">It was recently brought to my attention that the San Diego Reader, a local alternative paper has printed hate speech against cyclists as well as threatening, and in the message boards, planning of violence.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">The article has been pulled from the web, but here's a cached version. I encourage reading the whole thing, but I have taken out choice bits for comment:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">http://74.125.155.132/search?q=cache:FaiufUjIemkJ:www.sandiegoreader.com/weblogs/daily-crasher/2009/aug/29/bicyclists-and-poditrists/+reader+san+diego+bicycle+crasher+podiatrist&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Here are my feelings. The columnist is sitting and waiting for cyclists to go by:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">"The light changed a few more times, and still...lots and lots of bicyclists."</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">So he does the right thing, at first: "I asked a cop in his car why he wasn't doing anything about it."</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">He did realize that what the cyclists was doing was actually legal: "It looked more like they were escorting them, though."</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">So they had a police escort. Just like a parade or a VIP. If important people were blocking the road, what would he do? He'd either turn around or he'd wait patiently.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">What did our friend do?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">"I took the gum out of my mouth and threw it at one rider. Then I picked a rock up off the ground and hit another."</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">So he attacked them.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Why would he attack a group under police protection?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Because they are riding bicycles. Implicit in this is the assumption that bicyclists are beneath him. They must wait for him, they must get out of his way. He does not need to accomodate them in any way. NOT EVEN WHEN THE LAW IS ON THEIR SIDE. In fact, he still continues to believe that by riding bicycles, they are criminals. In fact, not only are they criminals, but he believes he can attack them with deadly force and "worry about the consequences later."</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">"But I swear, next time I see a group like this, they better hope I'm not the first car. When the light turns green, I'm going. I'll worry about the consequences later."</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">So even though there is police protection, he still thinks that he has the law on his side. A law that only he knows about (this is not on the books). He so strongly believes in this higher law, a person in a car is so superior to a cyclist that they can kill them, he doesn't even respect the police escort.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">I'm glad he wrote this column because in doing so, he exposed a lot of hidden assumptions that people have about bicyclists. Before we change people's minds, we have to realize how they think.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">The next question is. Where did he get this idea? Who told him it was OK to attack people who were different?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">I don't know the answer to this question. Even when I owned and operated an automobile, I thought that it was horrible how people talked about cyclists and homeless from their automobiles. I would be embarrassed to express such selfish and hateful things.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Instead, it's published in a column for all of us to see. And the San Diego Reader proudly put its title above the article. Until the legal department realized what a disaster the article could be.</p>
I feel that they should apologize for the article, print a retraction, take a stand against violence against ALL groups, and fire the Crasher without compensation.

It's one thing to write an angry column. It would have been OK to take a firm stand against Critical Mass. A few jokes would have been great; I love cycling humor.

But to write a column like this shows a complete lack of judgement that at this point, I don't think can be learned at least not while on the job. This is a basic thing like brushing your teeth or leaving the house with clothes<strong> </strong> on that people should be expected to know before they take up journalism. If they have not learned it yet, there is something missing in their psyche.

Even to say it sounds like you are five, "You shouldn't hurt other people."

But I guess sometimes people do need to state the obvious.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Surly Saga</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[
My wife and I originally bought Surly Long Haul Truckers in Philadelphia for a long distance trip. Originally, we both had back racks, but someone online suggested getting a front rack for me as well because I'd be back heavy, and I could fall backwards on a steep hill. So we went to Eastern Mountain Sports and bought a front rack. Before deciding on one, we asked if it was compatible with a Surly Long Haul Trucker. They insured us that it was--they even checked in the back room with an unseen "bicycle expert."

During the ride from Philadelphia, PA to Dallas, TX, our Surlies served us well; we never had a mechanical problem with them. This trip was about two and a half months.
When we got to San Diego, we continued to ride them daily. We never did anything too crazy just some daily commuting and grocery shopping.

After about seven months of bicycling in San Diego, I noticed that it was harder to get into a gear and to stay there. I have friction gears so I need to tune the right gear. Usually this works quite well, but recently, I found tuning the gear to be impossible.
During around the same time, I found that the shock from riding over pot holes was worse than usual. Anyone familiar with cycling in San Diego will know that there are pot holes pretty much everywhere. They are just something you have to deal with. You can avoid some, but overall, you are going to hit a few. That's OK because I had a great touring bicycle that was designed to withstand thousands of miles of heavy riding.

My bicycle doesn't have shocks, but it usually handled rough conditions fairly well.  I figured that the recent extra shock when riding over pot holes was lack of air in my tires, but each time I felt them they seemed to have enough air.

The next day, I hit a large bump on the street, and I took it far harder than usual. This is the type of bump that's a real wake-up. The thing is the pot hole wasn't really that big compared to how much of a shock hitting the pot hole was.

Since I this happened right outside my house, I parked my bicycle and got the air pump. When I got back out, I noticed the crack in my down tube. Instantly, I knew the truth: my bicycle was trashed. Not just a bit broken. Not an expensive part, but rather my entire frame had gone from being my way of getting around to a piece of heavy scrap

Suddenly, all the places I needed to be at seemed much further away. Many things that I liked to do such as group meditation, group rides, swimming in the ocean, and riding with my wife to work were unattainable. All this flashed through my head in a seconds.

Immediately, I emailed my wife the bad news. She called me and we talked about it. Then we contacted the manufacturer.

They took about a week to get back to us. When they did, they told us to take it a local bicycle shop, Adams Avenue.

When I got there, they all ready knew what was wrong with it as they had seen the photos we had posted on the bicycle forum. In the Age of the Internet, word travels fast in the bicycle community.  I walked the frame up there and waited for about another week.

They told us the Deal: we could buy a "crash" frame from Surly for $300. Labor on the bicycle would cost $160 which would make the whole deal $460. This is a little less than half of what I spent for the bicycle new. This is also more than a hundred dollars more than what I had paid for a NEW bicycle, previously.

Ignorant of bicycles especially Very Expensive STEEL bicycles that crack apart in less than a year, I was not sure that this wasn't the manufacturer's fault. I was suspicious at the "deal" price for the frame I had been told that the price was near the cost price for bicycle shops. I was unhappy because I had not crashed my bicycle, and thus I didn't feel like a "crash" frame was warranted. By the way the steel broke, I was pretty sure that the steel was not very good quality. I mean, steel bends, right? It's not glass. I bought a metal that I thought was malleable; my bicycle wasn't made of glass.

I went to pick up my bicycle from Adams. To my surprise, they had not yet stripped the frame, something they were going to charge me $40 for. I was a bit elated because I was able to roll out of there without paying anything. After all, I wasn't going to deal with Surly after all.

Many people told me to write a stern letter to Surly so I did. We had heard great things about the company, and we wanted to see them in the best light. So to give them a chance to make things right, I wrote them a letter.

I got back a letter from Surly explaining that my front rack had smashed into my frame over and over again which had created a hole in my frame. This hole allowed water to leak into the frame which rusted.

Surly did explain that they thought that Adams had explained the situation to me, and they were sorry that communication wasn't better. I appreciated this. I also appreciated them explaining that steel does indeed crack. OK, I'm not a metallurgist. I did not appreciate the way they explained this to me. I didn't like the tone. They know more about steel than I do, OK.

I found this hard to believe as my bicycle was exposed to the rain only about three times while on the road.

I examined my frame, and I saw no evidence of rust. Angered, I took a digital photo of the frame. In the photo, it did show evidence of rust. Also, there were spots on the front rack with the paint completely chipped off due to collision with the frame.

Later on, people informed me that the place on the frame that cracked was not a common place to find a manufacturing defect. I was slowly accepting that my frame was broken, and I wasn't going to get a replacement for a long time.

The San Diego bicycling community did not accept this assessment. No less than five people offered me bicycles. At first, I turned them all down. I feel scared enough riding a thousand dollar bicycle that I own around town. There's wear and tear as well as risk of theft. I don't wish to risk someone else's bicycle. Other volunteers included: Thom (a fellow cyclist), Julia (a fellow mediator), Sky (owner of Velo Cult), and Shamus (owner of Fix).
I felt so good knowing that people were so kind.

Ted was the most insistent so I borrowed his bicycle which he even dropped off at my house. It felt so great to be on a bicycle again, but even better to know how many people cared.

So there is a happy ending to this story.

  <title>San Diego Bicycle Coalition Retreat: Fail</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2009/12/14/san-diego-bicycle-coalition-retreat-fail/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I was invited to provide input at the San Diego Bicycle Coalition Board Retreat last weekend. The purpose of the retreat was to get more people involved with the coalition as well as more, young people.

The meeting was four hours of mind numbing back and forthing. My head is still aching from the meeting. Long meetings where nothing really gets done tire me out.

Therefore, I'll refrain from going into detail on the meeting, but here's an executive summary.

The retreat was a failure.

Oh, the retreat did succeed on some levels. It was the kind of consensus building format where everyone gets to voice all their opinions and only what everyone agrees on is done. Which is to say nothing is done because a small group of close friends can't agree on pizza toppings. Thus, consensus leadership doesn't work.

If the bicycle coalition wanted to get only things done that didn't offend anyone, they need not exist. Everything new change can be offensive. Therefore, an effective bicycle coalition will offend _more_ people. 

Needless to say, my remarks were so offensive, they were completely ignored.

My request was that the bicycle coalition start acting like every other advocacy group in that it had a long term vision of what success looked like. I also thought that they should advocate things. That is, ask the government to do things that aren't being done all ready. I also suggested that for San Diego to
be a leading city; following other cities wasn't enough. Even if we did everything that the leading bicycle cities did, we'd still be a follower. If we want to be a leader, we need to do _new_ things other that places aren't doing.

Last weekend, with no push back from government and no complaints from motorists, the coalition decided that we are going to spend 2010 as followers.  

With this predictable outcome, I feel that I should not have attended this meeting. My time would have been better spent on a bicycle ride that just happened to occur at the same time as the meeting: the Tweed Ride.

While the people at the coalition droned on about fun, the Tweeders were having it. 

The coalition even mentioned the Tweed ride, and said, "We need to make maintenance fun."

This was in response to the false dilemma that we spent half an hour debating. We went back and forth over whether we should focus on new infrastructure or maintenance. They, of course, chose maintenance. There's nothing sexier than wasting our time trying to get the government to do what it is supposed to do.

I can see the slogan now, "San Diego: World Class Bicycle City; We Sweep Our Streets". 

I realize that in one year, we will not get everything we ask for. However, I don't think that should be the goal. In any negotiation, you ask for more than you think you'll get then back off from there.  

The coalition seems to think that we should avoid disappointment at all cost by asking for as little as possible. In fact, instead of asking for new things, they feel it's best to ask for a fraction of what is legally ours all ready. 

I just can't get excited about fighting a rear guard action. I can't get stoked about diminishing returns. In fact, the State of California, in legislation is ahead of San Diego with its Complete Streets Act which the city has yet to begin to implement. Did the coalition think that we should try to get the city to get up to standard code? 

No.

They are happy with fixing stuff that we had before complete streets. 

Their reasoning? The city streets have sucked for a long time.

After the Tweed ride and the coalition meeting, both groups met at a Western Themed bar in South Park.    

Here, we saw the stark duality between the coalition and the rest of the cycling world. 

The coalition arrived at the bar first. They joined us at a long picnic table. For half an hour, I sat and listened to my ideas get shot down, once again. Then I got up and mingled with the Tweeders who were all over the place.

The times I did glance back, the coalition members were all still
sitting at the table.

I joined various groups of Tweeders. They were all polite and happy to talk. Many listened to my voting cheat sheet idea, and some even wanted to get involved. Many voiced ideas that were far more profound than anything we came up with at the stale coalition meeting. The conversation was stimulating and exciting. Still, no sign of the coalition, who's backs were literally turned on the people who were most active in cycling.

How did the Tweeders get to the bar? They bicycled. Meanwhile, most of the coalition members drove the short distance from the meeting to the bar.

Neither groups really mixed. No ideas were shared.  Another opportunity to meet with the community was lost.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I came up with a letter, but when I went to the Sandag website, I could find no where to submit it!

There was only a way to contact the webmaster. I'm going to send it them and see what's up.

Below is the letter:

Greetings,

I am a cycling advocate who would like to do for bicycles what
the AAA has done for the automobile, guarantee Americans, who
so desire, universal mobility by bicycle.

In the past, I had thought that the policy of keeping bicycles
off the freeway was sound. After all, why would I want to share
space with vehicles that are much faster. Add the smell of
exhaust and the constant din, it seemed like a perfectly
logical solution.

However, recently, I had the misfortune of having the last
trolley canceled without warning and without indication.

Unlike the other two dozen passengers who were now stranded in
El Cajon, I had a bicycle. I could feasibly ride the dozen
miles home.

I started out naively thinking that El Cajon Avenue would take
me straight home. This turned out to be untrue as I somehow
managed, with no intention of my own, of winding up on the
freeway. Knowing full well that I was breaking the law, I took
the first exit. 

Immediately, I got lost and even turned around again. I did
have a light, but it was not the brightest. I inadvertently
ended up on the freeway again. Again, I took the first exit. I
was at Grossmont Plaza all ready. I was finding my bicycle ride
to be much quicker than the trolley.

Again, I got lost.  Seeing a police officer, I asked which
direction was West.  He assured me I should go straight. I did.

I was on the freeway again.

Why was I breaking the law so much? Why did a police officer,
seeing I was on a bicycle, also suggest that I break the law?

It seems that there are freeways everywhere, and they are quite
unavoidable.

From my ride, I found that even on a bicycle the freeway is
much faster and more convenient than any street that has a
bicycle lane.

At no point did I feel unsafe on the freeway. In fact, my only
fear was getting fined for breaking the law. 

I feel that as long as freeway access is denied to cyclists,
mobility for cyclists will be an empty promise. 

The State of California and the City of San Diego are bankrupt.
Still, there is talk of tiny improvements to build
infrastructure for cyclists. Many people in charge feel that a
dollar spent on cyclists is a dollar taken away from motorists.

I would prefer not take money away from anyone. My proposal
would cost no more than the cost of this email: decriminalize
bicycling on freeways. Just stop wasting tax payer money
harassing cyclists who are just trying to get home from work
when public transportation has failed them.

Not all of us are wealthy enough to afford a car. Some of us,
for health or moral reasons, choose to limit our driving. Ever
since I have started cycling, I have personally been happier
than I have ever been in my life. I don't know why people like
me, people who also pay taxes, are denied mobility.

I want what's best for motorists, best for taxpayers, and best
for bicyclists, A truly Free freeway.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I just visited two pages from Mother's Against Drunk Driving, which is an organization which I highly respect. Here are people who took a tragedy and turned it into a mission to help others. 

However, I noticed one omission. I didn't see any information on _how_ one can go to a bar, drink, and get home safely. Yes, everyone knows about designated drivers. I agree with them 100%. 

However, many times in my 20's when I went out, it was solo. I was lucky (or smart) enough to always live close enough to a bar I could walk to. Barring that, I'd sometimes cycle to the bar. This is not as dangerous as you think.

It was only a few blocks on some quiet streets especially late at night. If I crashed, I'd only hurt myself. This never happened. If I was too drunk, I could always walk my bicycle on the sidewalk.

Other ways I'd get to distant bars was by public transportation. 

I think that it would be nice to have these on the front pages, and do more on alternative transportation politically.

In order to facilitate this, I wrote them a letter. Looking forward to a response. Regarding SanDag, they didn't get back to me yet. Probably after the holidays, I hope.

MADD Letter:

I have been a fan of MADD for years.

MADD's commitment to eliminating drunk driving gives me hope for the world.

I often think about how many people died for no reason due to drunk driving, and I have struggled to come up with some ideas on how to prevent more drunk driving.

I'm sure that it hasn't escaped your attention that many bars can only be reached by automobile. That guarantees that many people will drive drunk due to logistical problems.

By making it necessary for someone to drive from a bar not only does society seem to suggest that it's OK to drink and drive, but it also makes it a necessity.

If alternate transportation were made available to bars, drinking and driving would go down. This is proven by the success of the St. Patrick's Day pub crawl buses which eliminate the need for drinkers to drive.

Eliminating bars from places reached only by highway exits and reducing parking at places that provide alcohol would also reduce drinking and driving.

I know many people who would walk or take a bus to a bar, but drive instead because this is the only way to get there! Therefore, alternate transportation needs to be available at the hours when people drink. Often buses and trains stop service far before two AM, and they restrict service on weekends which
again, enables drinking and driving.

Finally, in places where buses and trains are not available, a bicycle is a much safer way to get to and from a bar. The bicycle has the advantage that the only person at risk is the rider. Imagine how many people would be alive if cars had the feature that they didn't endanger anyone, but the driver!

Again, in many places, due to poor road conditions, it is unpractical to ride a bicycle to a bar.

If you are interested in exploring alternative transportation methods as a means for people to get to and from the bar, please let me know. Also, please let me know some suggestions on what can be done.

Currently, I am preparing a questionnaire that will be used to prepare a voting "cheat sheet" for those who wish for more alternate transportation. It would greatly help these efforts if MADD lent its credibility to this endeavor. 

Wishing you the best,

Fred Ollinger

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[On Christmas day, I decided to open my biggest present. 

No, not any crap under a tree. Rather, it was a bicycle that takes place each month: Critical Mass.

I missed the main ride because I was going to the bathroom, but I did run up with a group that called themselves "Hungry Bear Nation." Why, I don't know. I don't think that's important.

The people were really nice, which was less of a surprise to me due to living in San Diego for a year now. Still, it was a bit strange that a group of friends who didn't know me took me in so nicely.

We rode from Balboa down Laurel where one of the riders crashed on the steepest part of the hill. She was fine. 

We rode bay side and took in the grade A view of the lights of Downtown and Point Loma. Excellent route especially as most was off road.

Then we cruised around a deserted Sea Port Village. It was quite beautiful.

Then we got some beers and headed back to Sea Port Village. We talked for a while. Two of the guys have an online t-shirt shop. Some of the people are considering moving from LA to SD. We listened to Kayne West.

Finally, it got pretty cold, and we called it a night.

I got on my bicycle and headed off with one of the guys. What a wonderful night. 

Each time I ride Critical Mass, I meet at least one other interesting person. 

If you are opposed to Critical Mass, I suggest you spend one night out of the month riding with us. If the traffic blocking is a problem, I urge you to do your errands on a bicycle that night, at least. That way, when you come to the Critical Mass, you will meet with no obstacles. You will be one of us. Happy and free.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Dangers of (Not) Cycling</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2009/12/30/dangers-of-not-cycling/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[People are often good at determining lesser dangers, but they are not always experts at the larger dangers.

One example is cycling. People are pretty astute to realize that getting hit by a car is dangerous.

However, do they realize that not cycling, itself has dangers?

Aside for the real, but rare and silly dangers of getting hit by a car while sitting in one's house, there are other dangers of not cycling. The main one is heart disease and diabetes which are some of the biggest killers in the US.

Just sitting around, letting yourself atrophy, you are running a greater risk to your life than any out of control Hummer.

This is why I feel that it's not accurate to compare bicycle collision rates with automobile rates. The risk of sedentary diseases also need to be considered.

Yes, you can drive to the gym, but is that "efficient" and "time effective" which are two things that the auto lifestyles was supposed to bring it. Or is it more efficient to excercise and get places?

Finally, if you look at the statistics, riding a bicycle is not far more dangerous than driving an automobile anyway. In many cases, a bicycle is safer.

Here are your ways of getting hurt on a bicycle: 

1. Getting hit by a car (often fatal).

2. Falling off/collision (often just painful enough to teach you not to do that again).

Ways of getting hurt by a car:

1. Getting hit by a car (often fatal). Contrary to popular belief, getting hit by a car while in a car can be just as dangerous. Why? When you aren't in a car, you don't have the risk of getting crushed inside the car. If you don't think this is common, why do you think that they invented the "Jaws of Life"?

2. Hitting something (often fatal).

3. Rolling (often fatal).

If you still haven't grasped things, look at it this way. Bicycling, in and of itself, is a pretty harmless activity. "Bikes are harmless."

If there were no cars or bicycles on the road, many people would still manage to kill themselves (see #2 and #3) above.

How many people died by getting hit by a bicycle. Yet how much outrage there is when a measly 4% of the population take to the pedals. At worst, bicycles should have 4% of the negativity and angers. Or less. They seldom kill people.

Finally, it should be noted that bike salmon and other crazy cyclists actually make the road safer for motorists by waking them up. That is when they are not getting stuck on the truck's grills. :)]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Great post!

Research has shown that the health benefits of riding a bicycle outweigh the risks by 20:1.  With those kinds of odds, I am happy to take a calculated risk and go riding!  

Getting more people onto their bikes is productive,  focusing on the risks is not.  In fact, bike risk discussions are more likely to scare people off their bikes and into their "oh so safe" cars, if anything:  Note how car commercials and ads never mentions the "risks" of driving a car - yet, many bicyclists seem obsessed with it.

For the wider implications of the term "bike safety",  there is a great pro and con analysis on Wikipedia under the "Bicycle Helmet" entry (notably points 2 and 3).

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I love Mothers Against Drunk Driving; they are an amazing organization that has done a great deal to stop drinking and driving.

Recently, I learned that taxpayers actually subsidize drinking and driving, and they have a campaign to stop this.  According to a recent http://twitter.com/MADDOnline tweet, Alcohol-related crashes in the US cost the public an estimated $114.3 B including $51.1 B in monetary costs. People other than the drinking driver paid $71.6 billion of that, which is 63 % of the total cost of these crashes.

In response, MADD is advocating for supporting Tim's Law: SB 303 and AB 463: Support Tim's Law: SB 303 and AB 463 http://bit.ly/8SszLh

Sounds good.

However, I feel that though the drinking side of the equation has been beaten to death, we should address driving as well.

There are many bars where you need to drive to get there. In my mind this is a recipe for disaster because if you have to drive to the bar, you need to drive home. It's unrealistic to expect someone to go to a bar then to not drink. There's little else to do at a bar.

I think that designated drivers are an excellent idea. If I am stuck driving to a bar, I will always have a designated driver. 

However, I generally don't drive to bars because I generally don't drive at all. This makes it very easy to avoid drinking and driving. I usually will walk to a bar.

However, as stated above, this is not always reasonable. Sometimes we don't have a designated driver when we go out. Sometimes, we like to go out alone. Sometimes people get split up. Stuff happens when you are out. Even if someone gets drunk, they often won't take a ride home because how to they get their car the next day? Remember, they needed to drive to get to the bar in the first place.

I think that the alternative is to decide that we have gone far enough in advocating for more responsibility. It was a good run, and it has saved countless lives. Not drinking and driving is the right thing morally. This wasn't always the case, and MADD made a big impact for the better on society.

Now that this work is done, we need to move on to the next level.

I suggest that we should do more to make it easier to get to a bar without a car and harder to drive to a bar. Here are my suggestions. I'm open to new ideas as well:

Make it easier to get to bar without a car:

1.Beer van that will drive around and pick people up and take them home. Make this mandatory and free. Who will pay? I don't know. If we free up $71 billion dollars, we could pay for a few buses. This point pays for itself.
2.Make bars local to communities. Only have bars in residential areas. Encourage other mixed use residences. This seems to be the opposite of development at the time. This “new” development has put many people at risk for no good reason at all.

Make it hard to drive to a bar:

1.Limit parking at bars. In fact, if an establishment makes most of their money from liquor, they shouldn't have any parking at all. A parking lot is an invitation to drink and drive. Again, people should know better. They don't always. See above.
2.No bars off a highway. If there are no sidewalks to residential areas as well as public transportation, there should be no bar. Period. Ban all bars that you need to drive to.


These are tough changes to make, but they will benefit everyone even people who do not drink at all. Everyone will be safer and happier. Much money will be saved. I'm imagining much more than $71 billion as people will become healthier while walking to the bars, cutting down on healthcare costs. Gasoline will be saved which will lead to lower gas prices. Don't think that the amount of gas saved is small. People waste an enormous amount of gas just driving around looking for parking slightly closer to the door of their destination. We are talking millions of dollars in savings. 

Other than the initial cost, the down sides are minimal. There will be many other advantages that are largely subjective and difficult to quantify. These will be the most valued advantages of them all.

  <title>Advocacy 101</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The purpose of this document is to explain my bicycle advocacy efforts.

The situation as it is: overall, I think that cycling, especially in big cities like San Diego, is currently the best option for most transportation situations. I can get to the beach, work, and social events by bicycle. Last weekend, I rode about ten miles one way to play Dungeons and Dragons.

Thus, I currently do not own an automobile because I have no need for one. I have the option of renting one, but I never do this.

For me the benefits of cycling include a bonus of thousands of dollars which makes cycling a great stimulus package that happens every year. Cycling is the gift that keeps on giving.

Additionally, cycling gives me a general feeling of accomplishment and well being. It keeps me in reasonably good shape. It gives me a feeling of connectedness with the city and with other people.

There are other benefits of cycling that I don't like to talk about too much which are externalized benefits which means that they help other people. I consider them to be part of the "bicycle bonus" but aren't the original reasons for riding. That is, cycling is better for the environment in many ways. It's less noisy and doesn't cause smelly pollution that we all try to escape by "geting away from it all" which really means escape from problems caused by too many autos in one place.

Cycling means less traffic, thus the more people who cycle the quicker motorists can get places. A lower demand on fuel means that fuel prices are lower when people cycle more.

Then there's the whole global warming and future oil depletion. Exploring these issues is an exercise for the reader.

The reason I don't like to talk too much about these latter issues is that they are too abstract for many people and require a certain understanding of science. Plus, one can sound a bit preachy and pompous, and I'd like to get away from that.

For me, number one in cycling is that it's fun and practical. These considerations outweigh all others for me.

So why not just enjoy cycling and forget about the advocacy?

I'm often tempted to do just that, but I feel a small amount of fear that things will change for the worse. In a bicycle, you are too often made aware at how much your commute is controlled by people who live very far away from you and do not know you. That is "traffic engineers". I fear that a couple of lines on a piece of paper and my commute will be ruined. This has happened before.

I especially fear traffic engineers because they have much different goals than I do, for them most part. Their overwhelming obsession is moving a large volume of autos from one place to another. This is harmful to me because vehicles that drive too fast make cycling much more dangerous and challenging. Speed kills.

It also makes things more noisy, smelly, less fun, and everyone, including motorists, wind up frazzled and stressed out. They don't call it road rage for nothing. I believe that road rage is literally caused by road design, and the mentality behind these designs, which is obsessed with speed over tranquility and happiness. I think that this is wrong because it's a highly unbalance view of life. It's certainly simpler to just wish to maximize one variable, "speed", but then we lose sight of what made motoring pleasant in the first place which is comfort, tranquility, and luxary. Being moved around like a rat in a maze is not luxurous--it's stressful and harmful to people.

I have seen the nicest people in the world get highly angry over the movement of other vehicles as seen through their windshield. I'd prefer to live in a world that strives to bring out the best in people, and I think that cycling (and other transportation options) can be a big part of this dream.

An additional impediment to this dream is the other side of the through street which is the "residential street" model which is also harmful. When motorists are home, they have a good intiutive grasp of the damage that too many autos
cause which is why one hand they try to maximize their own speed at great public cost, but they also try to minimize speed and traffic in front of their own homes.

While this is understandable in the short term, in the long term, it hurts all of us because the lack of options puts more traffic on the through streets which in turn needs to move faster for people to get anywhere. These streets are more expensive to maintain because there is more wear and tear. They are less hospitaable to cyclists. Plus, there is a danger in case of emergency to having few options in case one street is blocked.

To sum it up, I have a little bit of fear that I will not be represented when decisions are made regarding road design.

My second reason for bicycle advocacy is that I'd like to share the benefits that I have had from cycling.

Often advocacy consists of "raising awareness" or "changing minds and hearts." I have little interest in either activity because if people aren't aware of the benefits of cycling by now, I'm not the one to change their minds. I feel that it's pretty self-evident.

I also don't like to change people's minds. I used to go that route, and I have discovered for me the route to madness. In general, I feel that people have their minds made up. If you disagree with the last statement, ask yourself how willing you are to change your mind and agree with me that few people are willing to change their minds?

I didn't think so.

So what is my advocacy all about?

I decided to look at organizations that had a powerful impact on the American landscape. I won't itemize them, because there are so many, and the winners are so clear, but I would like to talk about their techniques that work.

Of course, anything that is unethical, I will not pursue.

But anything else is up for grabs.

My first idea is political endorsements. Successful organizations back candidates that are sympathetic to their interests.

Second, I am a member of the San Diego Bicycle Coalition.

Also, I am listening a great deal--attending meetings, asking fellow cyclists what would make them happier, and discovering what prevents current motorists from cycling.

As to the latter issue, the thing that comes up over and over again is bicycle specific infrastructure improvements. Thus, I am focusing on this issue.

The questionnaire that I sent to City Hall has some questions pertaining to the council member's attitudes on infrastructure.

Aside from infrastructure, I have a strong opinion with regards to our freedom of mobility, which is actually taking a page from the AAA. They would like to restrict cycling and pedestrian activity because they feel that it takes money
away from "mobility". I believe that while they are correct in their advocacy towards greater mobility, they are mistaken to artificially restrict our choices.

I believe that the AAA has good reasons for limiting competition for the industries that they support. But I do not think that the AAA's policies benefit the country, as stated above.

I'd like to reclaim the notion of mobility in a more broad fashion. That is, I believe that in a free country like our own, freedom of mobility should be our right. If we want to get to work by bicycle, auto, foot, or by bus, we should
be allowed to. I think that we can't have a truly free market if there's consistantly only one option.

What we have now is akin to a communist store where there's only one flavor of cheese. Often, we have only a single flavor of transportation.

Having more choice will actually reduce costs because in monetary (and environmental terms) motoring is the least efficient mode of transportation.
Think about it, what could possibly cost more than each person encasing themselves in several tons of plastic and steel and the energy to move all that around.

I am not against motoring, but I do not feel that it has been given a fair place in the market. I feel that we should have a more free market for transportaion options by having more choice.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Escondido Enforces The Law and Generates Needed Revenue</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2010/08/11/escondido-enforces-the-law-and-generates-needed-revenue/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I found <a href="http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2010/aug/04/city-lights-2/">this article</a> to be excellent because it exposed some of the myths surrounding our transportation system.

One of them is that once one signs up for an auto loan, one may go out and break the law with impunity. This is not true.

The laws regarding motor vehicles are there to protect us all. If one has problems with motor vehicle registration, they should just say so and the drunks,  serial felons, and the criminally incompetent can start killing even more people on the freeway.

No, most people agree that in order to keep order, we must abide by a certain number of laws, and the City of Escondido's finest were just enforcing existing laws which is their job. I know that it's trendy to attack the United States now, but if the police are abiding by the laws, the rest of us should, too. After all, we have the government that we deserve. If we didn't campaign for someone different, we have to live with who gets elected and, yes, follow the policies that they enact.

Secondly, it made me ill that it paraded children around as if our transportation system were put into place in order to benefit them.

Nothing can be further from the case. The unintended consequences of our system, especially in Southern California, is killing us all. Many of us literally.

We have too much debt and no job, but we feel that we need a car because there are few reasonable alternatives. Despite the year round weather, we are cramped up inside little boxes. We are destroying the beauty that brings people to to this part of the country with toxic fumes cause and exasperate an illness that of which one out of six are diagnosed in Southern California. And, with it's automobile obsessed mindset, of course, <a href="http://www.kidsdata.org/content/Asthma%20Landing%20Page/Default.aspx?gclid=CJDkz6igr6MCFQVcagod028H6g">the highest incidence is here</a>.

If we thought about the children, we'd design a system so that they can walk to school as children are increasingly diagnosed with <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/projects/cda2.htm) of which the leading cause is obesity (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2#Lifestyle">Adult (that's right, Adult) diabetes each year</a> .

If we thought about the children, we'd realize that one of the most dangerous things that a child could do is to get into a car. Car accidents <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/LeadingCauses.html">kill children</a>.  Therefore, ironically, the most dangerous thing a parent does to a child is to drive them somewhere which shows how biased the media is when compared with the amount hysteria media whips up against a parent who allows their child to
take a much safer mode such as walking or the trolley.

The fact is, the City of Escondido <a href="http://www.nctimes.com/news/local/escondido/article_d3893076-7efe-5c33-aa2a-360f46352f57.html">needs money</a>, but people, unaware of how civil society functions, are too selfish to pay more taxes, so they have to be creative in generating it. This program is brilliant in that it does generate the revenue, while at the same time it gets law breakers off the street, some of whom would have gotten into an accident, and--yes it happens everyday--killed a child.

So if you cared for children, you'd support raising taxes, and building decent sidewalks, bicycle lanes, and public transportation that actually works (see the metro system of LA sometime to see a transportation system that is both beautiful and useful).

If you write an article that says that it's going to help the children, look at ALL the facts. I'm not going to judge anyone, but if I had children, I'd make sure I had a backup plan because: cars break down, they are expensive and take away from college money, accidents happen, and yes, you can lose your car if you break the law.

I thought that the Reader was a conservative paper, but now it comes down in favor of law breakers, and against children's best interests and even the US government's ability to enforce the laws we all agree on.

Shame on the Reader.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Tribute to Bike Zero</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I'd like to take a break from the usual level of anger and screeds to spin a more positive story.

When I'm done, I promise that I'll get back to the regularly scheduled complaining.

For some reason, I have been reevaluating every aspect of my life. I don't know why, but perhaps it's because I am going through my mid-life crisis.

In my thoughts, I have been looking at what's been working in my life and what's not working.

Cycling is definitely one of those things that is working very, very well.

It makes me extremely happy, and I cycle as much as possible. It turns ordinary errands into adventures. I attribute bicycling more than any other thing for keeping me looking and feeling younger than others my age even more so than my complete and utter lack of maturity.

How did all this magic happen?

I have to go back to the first place that I lived after I left home in the ghetto of North Philadelphia.

Since having a car was expensive, risky, and unnecessary, I didn't have one. This was good b/c my classmates spent the majority of their time complaining about car related issues.

I mainly took the subway everywhere which was really exciting at the time especially when some of my classmates got mugged there.

One day, a great friend of mine bought me a bicycle: an old three-speed from the thrift store for $10. He fixed it up so it was ridable and gave it to me.

It was no speed demon, but Philly is really flat, and the distances were short.

One day, he came over w/ his bicycle, and we took a ride to the Italian Market which took us through the worst parts of the Bad Lands.

I thought that the ride was going to suck, but my fears were all unnecessary. The traffic was light (really poor city people have few cars) and nobody bothered us. Plus the ride was really entertaining especially that drunk dude that wandered around the middle of a street.

I didn't know it then, but I had taken the first sniff of the cocaine that was going to be life long cycling commuting.

There are a lot of wrinkles between then and there, but the upshot is that from then on, I always had a bicycle, and I rode it as much as possible.

The only thing that really changed was the quality of my bicycle is much improved, and I ride much longer distances than I thought practicable.

Though I think about my love for cycling daily, I never give the guy who kicked off this life long dream: Karl.

Thanks Karl for making me smoke that crack. Without you I'd be a flat slob.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Introducing Joy Blocking Motorists</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/introducing-joy-blocking-motorists/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Everyone knows about the dreaded Right Hook which is when a motorist, approaching an intersection, will overtake a cyclist then turn into and "hook" them.

In this context hook means "crash into".

There are many ways of avoiding the right hook such as riding further to the left into the lane, and checking behind one's left side before entering and intersection.

I try to do all of them, but there's still the chance that a motorist is going to go even further over to the left and to drive so fast, they literally appear out of nowhere after you have checked.

Obviously, after an auto careens in front of you, the only choice you have is to brake to enable the faster vehicle to execute a turn, and perhaps yell or ring a bell. I have done this many, many times, and I am still alive enough to type this.

When you get really good at it, you can even tap your brakes just a hair, giving them time to make your turn then you can continue upon your merry way.

However, there's an even stranger breed out there. I say stranger because the Right Hook does make some kind of sense: the motorist is in a hurry, and you aren't important enough to see. "I wasn't _looking_ for bicycles."

That's OK.

The stranger breed, I like to call Joy Blockers (originally CB, but I want to include everyone).

The Job Blocker will go for a Right Hook, fly right in front of you. Like a good cyclist who doesn't want to die just yet, you hit the brakes and come to a stop.

But surprise, they were just fooling you. They saw you all along.

Thus, after positioning themselves right in front of you, they slam on their brakes.

I have no idea why they do this.

Better still, just to show you how much they care, they sit there blocking your way EVEN AFTER YOU COME TO A COMPLETE STOP AND START MOTIONING AND YELLING FOR THEM TO TAKE THE RIGHT OF WAY THAT THEY APPROPRIATED.

They sit and sit and sit. In your way.

Why do they do this, dear God why?

If you have a rear view mirror, and ride in San Diego, you'll see many motorists wait behind you for the 3 seconds it takes to rush through the intersection then safely make their turn. The driver above could have done this. They could have went in for a right hook like an Real Adult.

No, they just wanna get in your way. Some of them even motion for you to go.

For me, this is a no go because sometimes you go and then they go to, and now you are in the meat grinder.

My guess for their motivation is the Grinch's 3 Second Heart Theory. That is, they are mean and greedy, and they just think of themselves and the juicy 3 seconds they will save while they do their NASCAR Right Hook.

Then, in the time it takes for them to pass you, their heart grows three times bigger, and they decide that they want to yield instead.

The fact that you saw them and took appropriate action and are ready to let by gones be by gones completely escapes them.

No, they are a Nice PersonTM, and they will let you go, damnit. So go like a nice obedient child. Sneak into the meat gringer and hope I didn't stop to check directions or fix my mascara and will be moving along WITHOUT LOOKING--this happens all the time.

Today, I have a New Plan that saves all this stress.

I call it the Left Hook.

If they come and try to Joy Block or Right Hook or some other stupid motorist nonsense, look over your left shoulder and pass them on the left.

Yes, this is pretty lame and simple, but now that I have learned this trick, my commute has gone from happy to double plus happy.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Tour De Fat 2010 </title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2010/10/04/tour-de-fat-2010/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I looked forward to this event all year, and this year I wasn't disappointed.

For those not in the know,
http://www.newbelgium.com/tour-de-fat
Tour De Fat is a bicycle festival that happens to have beer put on by New Belgium Brewing from Colorado.

The festival amuses many major cities on the West Coast and South West each year with its crazy, carnival atmosphere, free live entertainment, and beer.

The money goes to causes which I do not agree with, but they are only bad in a minor way while the Tour De Fat is fun in a major way.

Also, last year's Tour De Fat gave me a job to do for the first time in about two years. It also introduced me to one of my hottest fantasies which is to be a bar tender.

This job is nearly impossible to get, as one woman told me, unless you know somebody, are blond, and have big breasts. I lack all three.

But Tour De Fat allows us to serve beer for one day a year; thus this is something that I look forward to all year.

It was worth the wait because I love serving beer! My favorite part was seeing the different types of "men" who came to buy beer. About half were the std SD guy who were very polite and fun to serve. The rest were a mixed bag who probably read "The Game" or saw "The Pickup Artist" or something, and got the idea that they had to be complete assholes. Dunno. Some tossed their wooden nickels at me. Others had unnecessary dramatic pauses at odd times (for me to be awed?)

I soaked up the shit the "Alpha Males" gave me like a white person soaks up sunshine at the shore!

When two drunken idiots came up to take female co-worker "hostage" with a fake gun, I told them as much. I asked more more and more shit and I told them I was "eating it up".

They soon left.

Of course, after the serving was open, a friend of mine showed me an even better pattern for dealing with these yahoos.

When someone asked for a little of everything, he took the bucket of runoff and showed it to her, "There's some of everything in here."

She left him alone after that. Genius!

The only thing I'd do different next year is that, while I'd still hang out w/ all the wonderful people that I did, instead of just talking, I'd make some forward motion over to the interactive stuff like the crazy bikes because I'd really like to ride one.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Free Market Argument for Cycling </title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Ironically, in a country which has promoted and benefited from the free market, the United States takes a decidedly totalitarian and authoritarian view regarding transportation.

Because of deception by the unscrupulous few, the many in the United States pay a very large hidden bill--for transportation.

By the way of a highly sophisticated marketing campaign the good Americans have been deceived into thinking that driving everywhere is "practical" while they ignore the enormous costs to themselves as well as the collective costs. Some American children have even been deprived by basics such as health insurance and in rare cases, food, due to the excessive cost to getting to work.

Why are things so bad?

If we were simplistic, we could take the TINA view: There Is No Alternative.

However, if, using good old American ingenuity, we can find a better solution to our problems. We'd be remiss, however, in our research if we didn't take into consideration solutions offered by others.

The best way to do this is to travel, and barring that have experts from other nations come to the United States. The latter method was used for such impressive programs as our rockets program as well as our highway system--both of which were first implemented in Germany then the ideas filtered here.

Likewise, for transportation what better place to look that Copenhagen which has comprehensive infrastructure for the bicycle.

Naysayers will say that Copenhagen is not the United States and that the bicycle is impractical. Real Americans are never swayed by such negative people.

When looking for a solution that is going to improve our economy and rejuvenated our standard of living we must first look at all the data rather than blindly dismissing brilliant innovation.

People all over the world are riding the bicycle and reaping many rewards: a happy commute, exercise, and a deeper connection to their neighbors something that has been so lost in the United States that currently our great nation is boiling over with misdirected and impotent anger.

A bicycle trip across the country will teach one the great goodness of our neighbors in all 50 states. Additionally, it will reveal how much bicycling can bring people together.

This feeling of national connection and love of one's neighbors can only be established at a slower pace.

This talk of cycling might lead many to wonder why we don't cycle more.

The reason is obvious when we look at the rise automobile ownership which mirrored the rise of the freeway infrastructure.

Similar to the mantra for real estate, cycling is tied to "infrastructure, infrastructure, infrastructure."

Unless there's the proper facilities for cycling, it's going to remain marginal. Why don't we build it?

We have been deceived into thinking that transportation is a winner take all affair and that all other modes must be expunged. Such a selfish attitude is not becoming of the Americans I know.

I believe that most people will support bicycle infrastructure when they realize that it is critical to a free market economy. If bicycles can't compete in the market place then the government has all ready picked the winner in transportation.

Real Americans will not stand for such tampering in the market place. They will not stand for the creeping socialism which states that the government must provide for every single need of an automobile. It's hardly fair that machines should get free real estate hand outs in the form of parking while human being lack homes. I don't know a single human who lacks this basic decency that is a testament to good upbringing.

If someone can not bicycle to their job then by default the government has interfered in the market place and decided what that person should buy. This denies us all a basic freedom, Freedom of Mobility, which can be found enshrined in our hearts and values if not in our legal codes.

Thus the government should build a parallel, equal in utility, and separate from any interference by pedestrians, automobile, and animal alike in order for bicycles to compete equally the market place.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I appreciate your sentiment for a safe cycling network.

What you propose is not a Free Market solution. The current highway system takes money from all segments of the population, including those who may not even use it. You have no ability to stop funding it. This is a forced obligation. It is therefore the same theft that is perpetrated by all entities seeking government subsidies for any good or service. There is an endless list of those who receive tax and borrowed government theft, and it is engrained in worldwide psyche. Think everyone from farmers, to Amtrak, to 53% of Americans who receive some sort of entitlement.

A free market would produce a cycling network paid for by private funds. These funds would be investor funds, user fees, and reinvested profit from private entities who owned the network. The companies who owned the network would have a profit incentive to build the safest, and most innovative network the cycling market (users) could purchase. Such a private company would never consider it could make a profit by placing 15mph cyclists on glass laden barely useable "bike lanes" called shoulders where cars zip by often within inches at 50 mph.

The Free Market does not produce equality through government subsidy(tax, borrowing at interest through banks). The Free Market produces winners and losers. The winners in a free market would be a cycling network for cyclists, and a highway system for automobile users. They would be own by private companies with a profit incentive to innovate and provide the safest roadways for it's customers. They would police and set up their own system to collect the fees. Their system would work because the users would demand a convenient system. Think cell phones, computers, and televisions. Prices come down from innovation, and we receive better bang for the buck. The same would hold true for cyclists, as well as automobile users. In a fee market we'd have the best trail system our (users) money could buy.
I would gladly live in a free market, where I could choose what services to buy and which ones to allow to whither on the vine. In America, when it comes to the road system, or farms, or trains, or airlines, or 53% of the population receiving some government "entitlement", we do not have that option.

Please be very careful whom you ask to fund a"Free Market" cycling network. Your solution is no different than the one that forces us to fund the highway system cyclists mostly cannot use.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Helmet Fuzz</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, my wife and I made the decision to stop wearing helmets.

&nbsp;

For me, probably more so than for her, this was a difficult decision.

&nbsp;

It started when we met some wonderful women from Copenhagen, and my wife decided to ride helmetless in solidarity with them.

&nbsp;

I concurred.

&nbsp;

I found that during a bike ride without a helmet, the sky didn't fall.

&nbsp;

It was easier to see and more comfortable. Also, I thought about how fragile my body was and how a helmet gave me limited protection.

&nbsp;

This is before I heard about how useless a light bicycle helmet is.

&nbsp;

Of course, the backlash was quick and brutal, verbally, of course.

&nbsp;

To quote We Are Scientists, "You can't do this if I'm not listening."

&nbsp;

And I'm not.

&nbsp;

I thought about this decision long and hard. I'm too tired to argue every point, but I'll probably revisit this after some rest.

&nbsp;

Perhaps not. I don't feel a compelling need to justify nor explain all my actions and especially, in this case, my inactions.]]></content:encoded>

I appreciated your answer to my question about your feelings about helmets earlier today.  I didn't realize that this was such a recent decision.  If you have time do you mind to post links or share references to any statistical information or research that you may have ran across when making this decision.  In know how you and Sam like to investigate things.

I concur with the easier to see and more comfortable and would add that even the most stylish super over priced helmets imported from Europe are pretty dorky looking.  I know how you worry about being stylish.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Street Party</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/01/06/street-party/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Ever feel like there's a party where everyone's invited and only you show up?

&nbsp;

That's how I feel on my bicycle commute each morning especially when I get to the intersection of Aero Drive and Ruffin Road because this is the one spot where I get off my bike and hit the pedestrian cross button.

&nbsp;

I like to slow things down, at times, on my commute. When others drive really fast (&gt;35 MPH), I find myself subconsciously pedelling faster. I don't like it because I like to ride with purpose, and my goal is to be the happiest and calmest cycling on the road.

&nbsp;

Which brings me back to my thesis, I feel that others are excluding themselves from a good time. This doesn't bother me as much as one think because it's the same feeling you get when there's piles of money all over the ground, and you pick it up while others just walk right by it. If you try to point out the free money, they'll spurn you so, don't worry, I don't.

&nbsp;

But I do look at the drivers while I stand on the corner and wait for the very long time that the traffic engineer decided that, I, as a pedestrian, should wait. I try to use this as an excercise in patience, but I also like to try to see the driver's faces through their windows.

&nbsp;

Yes! I am that guy. Now you get to know what I am thinking.

&nbsp;

I imagine what each of them would be like if I could chat with them or if they were standing next to me on the sidewalk. The sidewalk would be crowded if everyone got out of their cars all at once, but they could narrow the road a bit and make room for more shops with apartments on top so that I could walk to work.

&nbsp;

If everyone were out in the street it would be wonderful. If they were on foot, it would be like my last time in Austin where I could see actual real people without a whole lot of tinting obscuring their beautiful faces. If they were on bicycles like me, I wouldn't have to hit a button and wait.

&nbsp;

I'd look forward to seeing them just like I look forward to seeing the men who nod hello while I coast by their bus stop.

&nbsp;

Instead, when I look at them, I wonder if they really see me or are they so caught up in the abstraction of driving where everything becomes an obstacle to be zoomed around--no time to say hello, every stop is an inconvenience and every interaction is potentially deadly.

&nbsp;

I wish that more people come to the party that I attend. I'm not alone because there are others whom I chat with along the way.

&nbsp;

Until then, I'll recall the words from the Dammapada:

&nbsp;

"We the unfrenzied live
happily midst the frenzied,
among the frenzied humans
from frenzy dwell we free."]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Tonight I ride in Mexico!

&nbsp;

One of the main reasons that my wife and I love San Diego is that it's so close to Mexico. Yes, that's right, we actually _like_ being next to Mexico; we don't consider it to be a problem or a "threat" to wall our selves off of.

&nbsp;

Since moving here, however, I didn't have a passport, but now due to my vast wealth that has changed.

'

Even better, there's a ride in Mexico called<a title="Paseo de Todos " href="http://www.meetup.com/Urban-Bike-and-Social-Club/calendar/15816144/?a=nr1p_grp&amp;rv=nr1p"> Paseo de Todos </a>which means "Ride for People Who Actually Understand Spanish". :)

I'm most excited about this ride because I would love to meet some Mexican bicyclists even if I will have some problems talking with them, we'll have a wonderful shared experience.

&nbsp;

Also, the people who I am going with are all super cool.

&nbsp;

Finally, I look forward to being in a Real CityTM. It's been a long time since I was in one.

&nbsp;

San Diego is nice and all, but I do not consider it to be a real city because the urban stuff is really spaced out and feels forced and fake like they saw a city on TV, but never understood what makes a city work. Hint: Density and cool people.

&nbsp;

What San Diego does best is natural beauty; also the people here are really friendly and kind.

&nbsp;

From the people who were actually there, I only heard good things about Tiajuana. You hear the negative from the media and people who watch the media.

&nbsp;

I can't wait to see the smiling faces on bicycles.

  <title>Ditched In Mexico!</title>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, this is probably my most exciting post, and it's probably the most exciting thing that happened to me ever.

&nbsp;

So we ride across the Mexican border into Tiajuana, and I am in love! The place is gorgeous. A real city.
Fuck San Diego, seriously, I want to live in Mexico.

&nbsp;

All the while, I'm in the back caboosing like I usually do to make sure everyone is together. We ride around a little until we find the mass of riders. We join up with them, and it's really great.

&nbsp;

A group ride in Mexico! What could be better.

&nbsp;

Plus, unlike in the US, their streets are better paved, and the drivers are tolerant even more so in nice town San Diego.

&nbsp;

Disaster struck, though, when going up a hill. I tried to pop into a lower gear, of course, and my chain got stuck between the cassette and the wheel.

&nbsp;

I pulled it out, and I found that in a lower gear, my derailler went into my spokes. This was probably due to my getting hit by a car earlier that day. Long story, I know.

&nbsp;

When I get stuff fixed a little, I run up the hill and everyone's gone.

&nbsp;

Great!

&nbsp;

A nice guy points out where they went.

&nbsp;

A few very long and scary--due to the quick traffic--blocks later, I saw nothing. No blinkies. No cyclists of any kind. Just lots of fast and pissy cars.

&nbsp;

So I decided to ride back home over the border then then 25 miles or so back to San Diego.

&nbsp;

At the time, I felt a bit freaked out because I'm in a foreign country where I don't know the language nor where I am at. I wasn't scared of crime or anything because everyone in Mexico was really nice. So far.

&nbsp;

Then I start thinking of drug dealers and the dude who got his nuts taped to his face and his body hung from a bridge. Uh oh. I was extra nice to cars in case they were driven by drug dealers.

&nbsp;

I got really distressed when I hit a pot hole. Pot hole! I was just raving that they actually kept their streets paved. The pot hole made my shit coats fly out of my basket all over the street along with my water bottle.

&nbsp;

At that point, I started laughing at myself. Here I was a dumb American trying to get his shit back into his basket while freaking out in Mexico. What a tool.

&nbsp;

I realized I had no clue where the actual border was nor how to ride back once I got there. Heading North doesn't work in a city like San Diego where every streets a potential cul de sac or even worse some of them take you back to where you started. Assholes.

&nbsp;

So I get a hotel for the night. The guy at the hotel asked me if I was Lance. I told him no, but I'd like to be him. On second thought, I said, no because I didn't want the cancer that came with being Lance. They didn't think that was funny. I wonder how they would have reacted to me hitting a pot hole. I need to bring a variety of comedy material to try out, I guess. :)

&nbsp;

I put my bike and went out like Anthony Bourdain looking for a low key place to eat. I found one and the tacos were great. I felt so cool walking the streets of a real city again alone. I even saw a Starbucks and looked inside until the people stared back like I was a freak.

&nbsp;

I didn't find a dive bar so I bought some Lime and Salt beer--they have that in Mexico! This is a totally amazing country.

&nbsp;

Then I went back to my hotel and watched Seinfeld in Spanish--the one where Kramer was wandering around with a meat slicer.

&nbsp;

My wife called me and some saint named Caeser picked me up.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Beefy Surf Ride</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Our newest friends, Andrea and Aaron, joined us on our weekly ride to the beach. The ride is about 11 miles, and it varies from being very pleasant--since it's on the bicycle path--to being fairly unpleasant--which is getting buzzed on Hotel Circle.

Last weekend, though, thanks to the addition of our friends as well as Hans and Beverly who met us at the top of Bauchman, the hill that connects Hillcrest to Mission Valley.

Having six people made the ride MUCH more pleasant.

We rode into Mission Valley then onto the OB bicycle path. We crossed over and rode over to

<a href="http://www.cheap-rentals.com/">Cheap Rentals</a> where I rented a surf board.

The waves were strong and someone accurately pointed out that the other surfers waited, far out in the ocean, for the perfect wave. Meanwhile, I stayed closer to the shore. That's because I'm a wave whore, I ride anything I can.

While I surfed, the rest of the people sat and enjoyed light conversation at Baked Cafe which is really surfer friendly. I change my clothes outside and even sit at the table in a dripping wet suit.

Once I was done surfing, we rode onward to <a href="http://www.lajollabrewhouse.com/">La Jolla Brewhouse</a> where we drank lots of beer including Celebration which has hops that are no more thanks to a housing project in North California. Yea, evil real estate developers of cinema lore!

There we saw some pugslies bicycles. If you don't know what they are ask a biking friend to tell you. I did.

Once we got tanked up, we headed over to <a href="http://www.homegrownmeats.com/">Home Grown Meats</a> in La Jolla where we stocked up on meat.

Then we headed back.

Overall, it was a perfect day in San Diego. The perfect end to a perfect weekend! Thanks to everyone who made it a wonderful day.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Bike Party!</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Last night at<a href="http://eltakeiteasy.com/"> El Take It Easy</a>, there was a bicycle party.

Of course, I got there super early and spent the time working on a comedy routine where I compare a loser in a political race with that of a pregnant, doglike carnivorn. Yeah, I'm looking at you Mama Grizzly.

The main thrust of my comedy is that I feel that she's mistaken in her attempt to characterize herself thusly, and as a gentleman, I point out the positive aspects of her character.

Of course, the party started, and Aaron shows up followed by the rest of the gang. Of course, my favorite person chastized me for being so foolish as to neglect to ask to bring my bicycle inside. Once I was allowed, I did so for fear that one of the wheels would be stolen. Yes, as a life long mental Philadelphian, I am super paranoid. I like my paranoia by the way so no need for a cure.

Later on, I talked to Andrea and Paul, two people from a home we were going to live in, but decided not to for various reasons. I'll get into that in another post.

After our house interview, we said to one another, "We should hang out with them more often, but never did."

Perhaps, now we will...

Then I just hung with my wife and friends. I was going to go around and meet everyone in the bicycle world that I hadn't met, but I felt too lazy. Perhaps next time.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Net Speed Limits</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[There's a funny thing about cyclists I know: over time we all seem to become amateur traffic engineers.

I'm no exception.

This is probably because we spend so much time outside of the bubble looking in. Also, for me, it's a survival mechanism. I want to know what the motorists are thinking so I can react accordingly.

One thing I have noticed, and I hope the real engineers for give my ignorance, but there seems to be a huge divergence between several speeds on the road.

There's the posted speed limit which nobody listens to. There's the speed that most drivers feel safe at which is what they try to drive; I call this the top speed. Then there's the net speed of traffic.

I estimate that my top speed, on my bicycle, on flat ground it about 20 miles per hour. In the city, I'm doing a lot of starting and stopping so I'm doing less than that.

What amuses me is how, often, automobiles will come extremely close to me to pass me in the city.

Overall, I don't mind being passed, in fact I like it because it means that I'm not hindering anyone; I'm not a burden on society.

However, it's annoying when they do so for no benefit at all which is often what happens while riding in the city. In fact, things get really crazy when there's even a little bit of traffic on a street such as El Cajon because I can keep up with traffic!

How crazy is that? What's worse is that streets like this are wide enough to encourage highway driving that is flooring it. But then a light appears and everyone jams on their brakes.

At this point, I catch up to traffic. I don't want the light to ruin my rhythm so I slow down ahead of time and coast, usually past a little traffic, until the light turns green, and I'm starting up again.

Here's where the second thing that upsets me occurs. The same people that squeezed past me, at great peril to my life and limb, now sit motionless while the light continues to shine it's emerald invitation. Only after a few seconds, the few seconds that were saved by passing, do they floor it again. Until the next light.

I estimate that autos can get to 50 MPH on El Cajon while I am riding a mere 20 on a good day. Yet we are getting to the same place at the same time.

Here's my proposal. I feel that we should be more realistic at what speed an automobile can actually go and adjust accordingly.

People jay walk all the time across El Cajon because the street is highly inconvenient otherwise; jay walking is necessary. But motorists are creating a huge risk. Hitting someone at 50 MPH is much worse than 20.

Also, we need to think of fuel issues. How much oil is burned each day so some motorist can get his rocks off while deluding himself that flooring it is actually getting him somewhere faster?

So there's the risk and the waste. I don't see any downside to getting people to drive a little slower.

Finally, I feel that the urge to speed is harmful to their tranquility and disturbs their lives. This is most important. I wonder how many arguments erupted and marriages collapsed because tempers were all ready high due to motor fuel speed intoxication? Perhaps narrower roads and lower speeds are the key to saving marriage in America?

As an amateur, I have more questions than answers so I will eagerly listen to what the knowledge that the experts have to impart.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, an article came out in the<a href="http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2010/dec/29/cover-bicycle-san-diego/">Reader</a> that was way more complimentary of cyclists than last year.

Readers may recall from a few years ago, the article where Josh Board admitted in print to throwing a rock at a cyclist (which I don't believe btw, a cyclist would have confronted him and/or had him arrested) and he even said that they "didn't deserve to be on the planet".

Wow, for riding a bicycle it makes us worthy of death and even elimination from the planet. Try inserting your favorite ethnic, race, political group, or even another normal human activity and see how that sounds.

"Wow, next time I see a trumpet player, I hope I am first so I can run him over. I'll worry about the consequences later. Brass instrument players don't even deserve to live on this planet."

Pretty messed up.

This year, the Reader had someone who was not a cyclist try to ride on and to explore the various communities.

The article was pretty typical for the Reader: setting the scene, slowly introducing the reader to the various bicycle communities, and giving a first hand account of how it is to cycle in this city.

He bemoaned the lack of infrastructure (true) and he bemoaned his feelings of terror (common), and his feeling that he was "putting his life in his own hands" (greatly exaggerated to the point of being false).

Overall, the article was fairly balanced as far as these things go.

To my surprise, there was a great sense of being wronged and of outrage in the cycling community. In fact, more, than the outrage against Josh Board's death threats, which I believe, in this time after 911, illegal, and even subject to Gitmo. Haha.

While humans, especially the intelligent once, can find fault with anything, I don't think that should be a way that we go through life.

I feel that it's our duty to make those around us feel better, and this means making ourselves feel good so we have excess happiness to share. If we spend our time fault finding then we are wasting our time.

Why not just find the good in the article and move on?

This is coming from someone who used to be much better at fault finding.

I used to be much more depressed, too.

All the time people ask me why I am so happy. Here's one of the reasons.

Working to be happy is hard work. Happy people are more curious and more interesting than depressed people.

Depression isn't a sign of intelligence, and it doesn't make one _deep_. It's a painful disease that is sometimes linked to mental choices that we make.

Anyone who knows me well will NOT call me stupid. Thus happiness is not a sign of shallowness nor stupidity.

When people see a cyclist who is upset, they assume that cycling makes them sad, and they won't want to do it. When a  cyclist is happy, the opposite is true.

In a city like San Diego, a cyclist who is normally dressed and has a reasonable commute can inspire many people. In our fair city, a cyclist who has a bad attitude can anger many.

Why choose anger.

I'll close with a Russell Brand quote:

"If, as is suggested by Eastern Mysticism and the movie the Matrix, that we can make our own reality, why not choose to see endless beauty?"

  <title>Boisterous Bluff Ascent in Search of Curdled Milk Loaf</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Last night, we did it! We climbed the baddest, meanest, and steepest hills in all of San Diego!

And we did it for cheese cake!

Someone figured out the exact number of calories each hill would burn as well as the number of calories that we'd gain by eating lots of cheese cake, pizza, and of course that cycling fuel: beer.

I'm glad I made it, and it's all thanks to an anonymous lycra wearing hero.

The route I took to the ride was down Linda Vista Road, which was flatter than I thought which is good because I'm finding that riding down San Diego hills is burning my brake pads faster than a box of condoms at an orgy.

When I got to the bottom, I found myself faced with a bewildering array of high speed merges all of which looked like they'd take me onto the freeway. Again.

I was looking for Morena. I didn't find it, but I was able to exit safely onto the OB bike path were I enjoyed a brief respite from the noise and smog.

I tried to pour over my hastily printed google map which was half sized which meant that half the streets were not labled. Ug.

I got back onto busy road again and I wound up on a crazy street where the speed limit was 15 MPH, people tried to drive 50, bumper to bumper on a two lane road where you could barely fit a few pieces of paper in between the cars. Yikes!

I turned around and headed back. Finally, I found myself, like many other tourists, to Old Town.

I circled around for a while looking for the the street names that I had hastily scribbled onto a post-it. Attracted by the cat calls of teen agers in a car, I rode over and asked directions. Confused that I was real, perhaps, he waved vaguely in front of him several times.

Again, I set out on my journey. I wondered how long it had been. I didn't want to be late. But no time to think of that now.

A smallish man on a BMX bike offered help. He lead me to my proper street. I wound up on Pacific Highway where my Spidey sense tingled, telling me I was going the wrong way.

I flagged down a lycra clad rider and implored him for directions. He offered to take me there.

I invited him to the ride, but he declined. 

He did, however, take me all the way past Pacific Highway, on quiet parallel roads. We had a pleasant chat then he waved me good-bye when it was time for me to ride on the side-walk. 

Through previous encounters, I have learned that the lycra clad, though they are often kind and helpful, they are also law abiding. This is usually a good thing, but like coffee or alcohol, too much of a good thing can give you the shakes and make you sick to your stomach. :)

I hopped onto the sidewalk, but I dismounted when I saw pedestrians so I didn't sully the cyclists good name. Hahaha.

A few blocks later, i was near India Street and the Five Points Brewing Company (in the old Mission Brewing Building). 

I grabbed a beer and joined the conversation, initially with a homeless person where we discussed the merits of saving old building such as the Mission Brewing Building.

  <title>Eye Contact and the Ghost of Mario III</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/01/16/eye-contact/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, as part of a personal experiment, I have been making more eye contact with other people both on and off a bicycle.

I have always been a quiet withdrawn person, so I thought that if I loosened up a bit, good things would come to me.

This has been true.

However, one unintended side-effect to this experiment has been my being less ashamed of being on the road.

Due to decades of social conditioning, many of us believe, in the core of our being that bicycles do not belong on the road.

Even those of us who commute daily, sometimes have this belief inside which Forester called Cycling Inferiority Syndrome or something. Though I don't subscribe to his VC ideas, this is one notion that was a great his great insights.

This feeling, and my inherent shyness, made me feel completely responsible for not getting hit and it made me a weaker rider.

Now, since I am making so much eye contact, I don't feel so ashamed to ride. I also notice that when I make eye contact, the drivers act much better.

Thus, I feel like I am in Super Mario Bros 3 where the ghosts follow Mario around. The only way to get them to stop is to face them. I, too, have a better feeling about traffic when I look, literally, at their faces, through their windshields.

In general, motorists are in a bubble, which is familiar to them, which makes them often forget that they are moving through public space. This creates a rage in them because it's OK to be angry at home, but not in public, but they ARE at home, in a sense.

When you look the motorist in the eye, this slices through their illusion of privacy. They often drive better.

Now, I am experimenting with looking behind me at the passing motorists, when I can. They often drive better, too. However, there are often intersections where there are people making a left in front of me, a can on my right hanging on the edge of the intersection like a chad in a Florida voting machine, and cars passing on the left. When I look at one of them, they behave, but as soon as I turn my back? Well, you have to play Mario 3 and get to the ghost level.

  <title>Mission: Soul Crusher</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Often when going to or from the beach, I ask to ride in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Valley,_San_Diego,_California">Mission Valley</a> because I think that it's going to be quicker to there: it's flatter, and there are less stops.

However, when I actually ride there, I find that my wife becomes very quiet. Last weekend, we discussed things, and it turned out that the reason she's so quiet is that she's so depressed that she wishes she could move out of San Diego immediately, and run to a large city which was planned on a more human and humane scale.

While I do agree with all of this, I have to ride through Mission Valley in order to get to work, and thus if I indulged in feelings of depression each time I ride into smoggy morass, I'd be unemployed.

Thus, I try to keep my chin up, and readers may not be surprised to hear that I actually enjoy my ride. All of it. Yes, some bits are better than others, but we need to be strong here. I'll write more about the joys of my commute in another post.

For now, suffice to say that I find the notion that Mission Valley is "soul crushing" is actually quite humorous because of its name: Mission. Valley.

When I think of Mission, I think of the goals of the imperialistic Spanish Catholic Church which was to SAVE the souls of the natives not to crush them. I won't get into the complex intersection of theocracy, imperialism, and their implications on global geo-politics right now, but soul saving was the goal of the Spanish Friar, Junípero Serra, when he set up Mission San Diego de Alcalá in 1769.

Later Mission Valley was dairy farms where locals living on adjacent mesas got fresh milk from. It may have even been raw. How hip and transgressive is that?

Sometime in the 60's or 70's some douche bags carved out of wall of freeways throughout the valley. This, of course, attracts malls like tea baggin' rallies attract government bought walkers, and the rest was history.

Now instead of the soul saving Missions, we have basically freeways and parking lots with a tiny bit of real estate left over for chain malls which are identical to those in every suburb outside of every city in all the United States as well as a few house projects some of which are so close to the freeway that you can see, hear, and smell it right outside one's patio. In fact the only thing separating it from the freeway is another road which is only slightly less busy! :)

So there you have it. If only I were a bit more sensitive, I could have saved my wife from this taste of hell. 

"Worse," she said.

No more Mission Valley beach rides. From now on, we are going to ride on the mesas.

  <title>Why Women Don't Ride?</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/why-women-dont-ride/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Sometimes, when we have exhausted most of our other conversational topics, my wife and I talk about the big question which is: why the wives and girlfriends of avid cyclist do not ride.

I know that this is a touchy subject so I suggest that the more sensitive readers should stop reading now.

I'd like to preface this with the fact, that many of my friends are women and they do ride. Some of them with a partner and some of them just by themselves. Many of them can kick my, and many other men's asses. Some are even car free in Southern California where common stupidity tells us that you "you need a car to survive here".

But just like a fly to sticky paper, I'm drawn to the forum <a href="http://sdbikecommuter.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=370&amp;page=1#Item_0">thread</a> titled, "A Couple that Rides Together. . ."

I'm not going to post any advice here, however. Like most things in life, I have more questions than answers.

Also, I feel that perhaps the whole question is due to a statistical fluke, a sampling error, and if I had a slightly different set of friends perhaps I'd be asking why more men don't cycle with their wives.

Why am I so obsessed with this question? Perhaps because I can't stand how people seem to think that I have somehow brainwashed my wife into cycling when in reality, she's a bigger cyclist than I am. She logs more miles, does more advocacy, she plans more trips, and she makes more cyclist friends than I do. 

It's a human thing to expect that our experience will be similar to other people's.

I guess the only way to really find out why these people aren't riding, and thus pleasing their men, is to ask the women. The only problem is the only time I could see them is on a ride. 

And they never come. :{P ]]></content:encoded>

  <title>I Have a Wonderful Vision of the City</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Note for the humor deprived, this is all a joke. It's just language and is meant to amuse.

Often people tell me that they are worried about cycling advocacy not because of what we have to offer but because of the "slippery slope." A bike rack here, a bike lane there, and pretty soon, we'll be living in Copenhagen.

Seeing as it's in the happiest country in the world, that would totally suck!

Very seldom do cyclist advocates show their hand and tell their motorist friends what the end game is.

Well, now, I drop the mask called counterfeit, and I display our true identity. 

Kilroy!

Just kidding.

In reality, cyclists want little. We want to co-exist. Also, we'd like things to be a bit flatter, faster, and more convenient.

We'd like a bit more respect. We'd like to have bike paths which are sealed off from the major roads. 

These paths can be created by the eminent domain of land: the govenment would pay what it thinks is market value to the home and business owners then it will bulldoze and flatten the area to create out paths. Each path will be a mile or so apart and the paths will criss cross the city. 

If a motorist comes to the path and wants to cross, we'll build some round about way sometimes a few miles out of the way to get around them. The hills, of course, will be much steeper than us on the our bicycle paths because the auto is capable of doing this with ease.

In some cases, the motorist will have to get out of his car and press a button before being allowed to go forward. We could automate this, but the bike paths cost billions so we'll have little money to spare. Besides, the motorists need excercise, and they'll get used to it.

Sometimes, to cross some really tough areas which are blocked off by our bike paths, the motorist will have to get out of his auto and take a bus to get to the other side. His auto will be loaded up onto a truck, and it will be waiting for him when he gets to the other side.

If anyone complains about this being unfair they will be mocked for being unrealistic, dreamers, communists and the like. They will be made to feel foolish for driving and be socially mariginal.

All the best things in life such as food, music venues, and so on, will be reached by bicycle, only. Also, in many cases, owning a bicycle will be necessary. In fact, you'll have to concel owning a car to get some jobs. This will not be seen as discrimination.

Finally, the topic of conversation will be the placement of bike racks, how there are not enough close enough to the door of the building, and how there are too many bikes on the paths so we need to widen them.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I Don't Give a Shitake About Celebrity...

With all the reality shows, there is a greater and greater urge in ordinary people to feel like celebrities.

While I maintain a nice, humble guy image, deep down, I'm the same as everyone else, and I want to feel important and unique. 

Although, I do have someone who makes me feel that I'm the happiest man in the world, the urge to celebrity is the urge to be special in the eyes of those who don't know you.

It's a little known fact that cyclists often stand out.

For example, when I ride, up the middle, to the front of an intersection, there I am out there all alone. Everyone else is anonymous in their autos, but I'm out in the open.

Also, at work and events, it's more noticable when I ride my bicycle. Others are pretty much all the same, but I always get a mini-interview where I get answer: how far I rode, how was my ride, and more.

As a hopeless attention seeker, I totally love it!

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Often when I ride my bicycle, I think of a scene from the movie <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basquiat_%28film%29">Basquiat</a> where he rode his bicycle in the park. He seemed so happy to be alive that, on his bicycle, he swayed left and right. My friend's girlfriend said, "I wish I could be that happy and free."

The thing is, that I am that happy and free. I sway back and forth whenever I have the chance. Often this is in the drainage ditch in my work parking lot in the morning. I am so happy to be alive and to have gotten to work safe another day.

Usually, this isn't a good idea on San Diego roads, but I have this feeling that some day, real soon now, it's going to be possible to do this everywhere in this fair city.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Edible Bike Ride</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Today, I went on an edible bike tour of San Diego which showcased ten of San Diego's Gardens. 

We started off at the World Beat Center in Balboa Park which is one of the real hidden gems of the park.

There they spend a huge amount of time recycling water. We also learned about how if one eats raw food, one needs to consume less. Overall, it was quite eye opening how much real wealth there was to be found in the smallest of places.

It was common knowledge that farming is difficult in San Diego because there isn't enough water. Although this may be partially true, I found the recent deluge to be a real eye opener because it seemed as if so much water was wasted. That is, water went from being a precious resource to being nuisance. I thought how nice it would be if they could capture a fraction of that water for watering plants.

The World Beat is also completely solar powered which is wonderful, but we learned that this was an uphill battle which is a real head scratcher.

From there we went to the Community College Garden which is worth checking out. Then we saw a bewildering array of back yard gardens which were all amazing in their own way. There's so much green in this city if you just know where to look for it.

Each of the gardeners were kind enough to show us what they grew. My list of gardening techniques has really grown since this adventure. 

I'm grateful that Ian and all the others involved were able to put this together. It's an experience worth repeating.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>News from A New York Bicycling Insider</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/01/24/new-york-bicycling/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[You may have recently that New York Cycling is  <a href="http://www.streetfilms.org/transforming-nyc-streets-with-jsk/">improving by leaps and bounds</a> thanks especially to the brilliance of <a href="http://www.esquire.com/features/brightest-2010/janette-sadik-khan-1210">Janette Sadik-Khan</a> an urban reengineer.

Well, last weekend, I got to talk about how those improvements were actually impacting bicyclists last weekend when I had a talk, on the Edible Bicycle Ride, with a New Yorker I'll call El.

She lived in Brooklyn and worked with a bike kitchen.

Since she was well dressed, I figured she rolled with the whole <a href="http://www.copenhagencyclechic.com/">Cycle Chic</a> scene. However, she was a bit surprised when I mentioned it. On the other hand, she was aware of Copenhagen's greatness in cycling.

In fact, she compared New York to Copenhagen and said that the former had a ways to go. I was a bit surprised to hear this, but not completely.

She summed it up like this: "In Copenhagen, the safest thing to do is to follow the law. In New York, however, sometimes you have to bend the law like riding through a red light can actually be safer for a cyclist if they time it right." 

Apparently, the way people drive still endangers people to the point where they have to make their own laws to be safe. That's a shame seeing the amount of infrastructure I continually read about.

Most of this infrastructure is in Manhattan, though. I wonder how the other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borough_%28New_York_City%29">Boroughs</a> are doing in contrast to Manhattan.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Hostage Negotiations</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/01/26/hostage-negotiations/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Nearly every single person I talked to, woman and man, has expressed interest in getting to work in another way than the automobile.

Yet very few have made the change. Why the disconnect?

I know that this is because mainly due to fear which is caused by lack of infrastructure. I believe that it's also because people want their decisions to be valued and appreciated by others and when we limit the cycling infrastructure, we tell people not to cycle.

Thus to argue that no infrastructure because people don't cycle is circular logic. The only way to break the cycle is to build something. By "something", I mean a dedicated bicycle path that goes from the person's house to their job just like the normal roads do this. 

Even though, in some ways, people are making a "rational" choice, they are doing so based on some negative beliefs, most of which are not born our in reality.

While it's true there is an occasional psychopath, these people kill motorists on the freeway as well as in homes, malls, and places of employment. They are very rare despite the joke--yes joke--that says, "If I see you on the road, I'll run you down." If only they had the stones to do so. They don't.

I do feel that saying something like this is a legit joke because it creates a level of shock which is the opposite of what people expect, and the laughter comes to break tension. Also, it demonstrates a point of view of superiority which is the same vein as other types of frat boy humor. 

Say what you will about me, but DON'T accuse me of not having a good sense of humor. It's one of the few things in life that I don't think is funny; it makes me angry. :)

Anyway, the title of this piece is Hostage Negotiations because I feel that people are held hostage by their irrational fear of the road. Even in the worst ghettos of Philly, nobody tried to run me down even though they most certainly could get away with it. Heck there are some areas where the police don't like to go--this is pre-Operation Sunrise.

I'd like to negotiate with people's fears and tell them that despite what they think, people are more decent than how they feel. This relates to what El called the way that cycling will "revolutionize one's life". 

Learning that people aren't as bad as one thought isn't the worst thing to happen to a person.

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I just finished the back end of Forester's Book.  It has really got me thinking.  I haven't come to a lot of conclusions yet, but I do agree in part with the cycling inferiority phobia concept he asserts.  We are marginalized in almost every way.  It is ironic that we are pushing for "bike infrastructure" in 2011 when the "Good Roads" Movement was started in 1880 by the League of American Wheelmen.  We have great cycling infrastructure if the cars would just get out of the way or at least slow down.  I don't agree with Forester's assertion that we are always safer on the road with cars.  He can point to statistics that show less accidents, but I like to assess risks on a scale that includes both frequency and consequences, and speed kills.  One conclusion that I made before even reading his book was that we could avoid all this with better urban planning, but now that we have a big mess, what are the best practices for bike infrastructure?

  <title>Pedaling Me Softly With My Bike</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I first started doing this when I rode my fixie through some South Philly ghettos, and I noticed that I had knee pain.

I took this as a sign that I needed to settle down a bit. I had been trying to fly by these "bad areas". On the other hand, I enjoyed my commute a great deal. In many ways things were way more entertaining. 

When you are in a gritty urban environment, there's a great deal of texture and differences to attract the eye. In these more pristine California highways that I ride on, there's far less detail, though I do enjoy the stunning natural beauty every single day.

In both places, my concept of soft riding has its merits. 

As I hinted above, a sore knee was the problem, but the solution has grown to be more of a hobby than just a band-aid.

Basically, this is as simple as riding as softly as I can. I go to a low gear even on flat pavement, and I try to ride with a gentle gliding motion. In a few days, this had fixed my knee trouble. Now when I get knee problems again, I will realize that this isn't really a problem, but rather a signal that I need to take it easy.

When I ride softly, I don't spin 90 rpms or whatever, I ride slower. I just press softer as well. I try to see how soft I can press on the pedals and to keep riding. This doesn't even necessarily make me ride as slow as possible, though I do find that I have to keep redirecting my legs to slow down especially on a fast moving road. 

I find that the auto traffic next to me has a profound and subconscious impact on my riding style even when I am separated from it, and even when I am not paying any conscious attention to it.

This has made me think of the other things that impact our lives in ways that we aren't totally aware. I will never be completely aware of everything that influences me, but to ride softly has slightly increased this awareness. In the end, this makes my commute even more enjoyable than it usually is.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[It's an inside joke between my wife and I that in order to really enjoy cycling in San Diego, you need to know the routes, that is, you need a secret decoder ring like the one that came in a cereal box.

Alas, there are not enough prizes in a case of cereal boxes to cut through the snarl that is the "surface streets" of San Diego.

I love the term "surface streets" because it makes the normal roads that I take everyday seem kind of freakish. It almost seems like the City of San Diego goes out of its way to make anyone who doesn't own an automobile seem like a Luddite freak! Perhaps they do. If so, I'm proud to be one of those.

Anyway, one thing I probably mentioned before is that I get told, all the time, after I have gotten to a place on a bicycle, that "one can not possible bike anywhere practical in Southern California".

The more I look at the world from the motorists point of view, the more I can understand (but never agree with) this point of view.

Indeed, when I first got to this fair city and started riding, I began memorizing what I called "the passes" which is the few through streets. 

I won't go on about my old home, too much, but in Philly there is no such thing as a "through street" because there were extremely few cul-de-sacs. 

This made for exploring more fun because you could randomly take any set of streets to get from here to there. In San Diego, there's usually only one route. These through streets are super-busy. Thus they make them wider. But there are too many cross streets. So they blow out of a few stop signs and make the perpendicular streets have to wait--perhaps indefinitely if traffic persists--to "speed things up".

Knowing all this now, explains why, 15 years ago when I was in school with many Californians, why they complained so much about Philly's poor design. Overall, I find it interesting to compare.

Also, I do find that there are some advantages to San Diego's design which is that sometimes one can create a really quiet route by stitching together a series of streets and meander around the through streets. Sometimes.

It takes skill and a lot of knowledge of the City.

Plus, of course, a Secret Decoder Ring.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>My Commute I</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[For 2011, I am trying not to talk about myself nor my life because things are so great, I don't want to brag. Plus, I don't want people to be jealous; I'd like to hear about how great other people are doing.

But occasionally, I hear negativity about cycling. I won't repeat it here. Overall, it's all nonsense. I have the statistics to prove that my lifestyle of a bicycle commuter is sound. But I don't need dry numbers to justify my decisions. I mainly operate on my whims and feelings; I and what I want.

Thus, I have decided to share how I feel every morning when I commute.

In the morning, I wake up, and the first thing I do is chat with my wife. We have a chat right after waking up, and right before bed because we feel that communication is important. 

[Skipping a lot of stuff--see first para. Yada yada yada. Blah. Blah. Blah.] :)

Once I have a pot of coffee in me, I can't wait to rush out of my house.

Ever see the most exciting scene, the climax of an action movie? That's what my commute is like.

Everyday.

I love it.

At first, it's a bit like off-roading because our back alley is so broken up, the only road that's visible sticks up in places like big rocks, and it would be better if there were no paving at all. 

Next, I go through the school zone where people are torn between wanting to rush away after dropping their child off, and acting holier than thou to fake concern for other people's kid. Note to parents, if you really care about other people, you'd walk your child to school. That way there would be less pollution for the children playing, less traffic, and less danger for the child getting hit. Plus, a bit of exercise is something that children crave which is great.

God, I love ranting!

I don't rant while I ride past here, I just smile (at the parents) and say hello. Plus, I watch to let the children go in front of my bicycle. Fear of hitting a child is a number one reason I prefer to bicycle over an automobile. I don't know how motorists live with this fear on a daily basis.

Next, is the buzz zone, where I dodge potholes while cars dodge me. Sometimes they squeeze past me only to get stuck at the light. This happens for about 5 blocks. It's really fun, actually, though I would prefer the pot holes not to be there.

Next step is the top of the big hill of Fairmount Ave. One more light, and things change in a big way.

Times up for this post so I'll have to continue tomorrow.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Since there is no clear voting guide for San Diego voters on their councilmember's positions on bicycling commuting, I sent the following missive:

On behalf of the San Diego commuting bicyclists, I'm collecting
information on politicians in order to inform the voters of the
positions of their representatives.

Most likely, you are informed about bicycle commuting since there are
roughly 150,000 of us in San Diego.

However, I'd like to avoid making assumptions because, sadly,
uninformed people often confuse commuting bicycling with critical mass
riders, fitness buffs and racers, as well as children. Thus I'll spend
a little time to explain what commuting bicycling means.

Commuting bicycling means using one's bicycle like a normal person
uses automobile: to get to work, to buy groceries, and to pick up
one's children from day care. Commuting bicyclists think as much about
changing their clothes to ride a bicycle as you would put on a whole
new outfit in order to ride in a car. A San Diego bicycle commuter
desires, but does not yet possess, all the rights, privileges, and
respect that motorist have been given by the government.

Right now, bicycle commuting in San Diego is not only possible, but
highly fun and beneficial. In general, bicycle commuters are thinner,
look younger, are happier, and save thousands of dollars per person
per year for transportation expenses.

Contrary to popular belief, the San Diego Bicycle Coalition has zero
representation for cycling commuters as it is a _coalition_ of sports
and hobby clubs.

Since there is no publicly available information on politician's
positions on San Diego commuting bicycling available, I'm collecting
the information to inform voters.

1. What is your position on government's role in cycle commuting?
Should government encourage bicycle commuting, discourage it, or
ignore it?

2. What have you done to change, according to your values, bicycle
commuting specifically in San Diego?

Thank-you.

I wish you the best in all your endeavors.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Over three weeks has passed since I first sent out the missive asking for feedback. I called one councilmember, and she didn't get back. I was all about ready to despair of getting any feedback when I received the following missive:

Hello Fred -

Thank you for your email.  The Councilmember has asked me to respond as I assist her with neighborhood services issues.

Councilmember Emerald very much supports the government's role in encouraging bicycle commuting.

In San Diego Councilmember Emerald played in integral role in a huge bike lane rehab on Kearny Villa.  As well she has been supportive of fixing bike lanes as we continue to fix streets.

Thanks,

  <title>The Hulk Attends Taco Tuesday</title>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Last Tuesday, I attended the Taco Tuesday ride. I had attended this in the summer, but I stopped going because I was too busy to work, and I didn't feel like peddling back from Ocean Beach in the dark and cold.

This week, they decided to go to a place that I guess is close to downtown which is on 25th and Imperial. Not a bad ride home.

After work, I peddled up Texas Street, and headed over to the Fountain in Balboa Park.

While I was there, I met an interesting person who talked about literature including the Booker prize.

Our fearless leader couldn't make it, but his lieutenant took over.

I can't describe how fun it is to follow a bunch of bicycles with all their blinkies in front of me. The air was cool, but since we were bundled up it was refreshing. We went down and up the hills of Morley Field across Florida canyon then over to 30th where we bombed down into Switzer Canyon, through South Park then we were at the place which is Spanish for facade because there are a series of trucks in front of the place, each of which is smaller and smaller like Russian dolls. 

Except there wasn't any truck there that night.

After the rush of the ride, the only thing going on for the rest of the night was probably the moving of the bicycle around.

We ate outside which allowed us to watch our bicycles. But then we were sitting around the corner so we moved them so we could see them.

Later on, someone in a vehicle that can only be described of as a cherry red, mini-tank edged closer and closer to our stack of bicycles as they couldn't squeeze the behemoth of their vehicle out of the parking lot. Now, as a rule, I don't judge. If you are going to bite off more vehicle than you can park, more power to you, just don't take your final for Driver's Ed 101 near my baby.

I rushed up to protect my and my wife's bicycle. At this moment, I feel that I probably looked like Bruce Banner when someone pisses him off. What they really did to make him pissed, I'm not so sure. I think he needs some meds.

Anyway, I was able to snatch the bicycles from harm's way before the genius behind the wheel was able to flatten them then (in my imagination) toss us a $20 for our "damages". I spend more than that on flair for my bicycle--it has to look good. :)

Anyway, we had to move our bicycles once more because they made a fire, and I didn't want to see my Rolex of a bicycle seat get burn holes in it.

Seriously, I'm feeling highly disrespected by the Fish Taco community. I just didn't want to get stuck on Imperial on a work night struggling to find the pathetic mess that San Diego thinks of as "public transportation."

I doubt tank driver would have given us a ride home though she could have fit the whole group of us in her trunk!

Anyway, my spouse (as always) supported my making a stand for all that's good in cycling and for rescuing her bicycle from the combination of a few tons of incompetence matched by the same amount of steel.

After that last "scene" we split off to ride home with a good friend.

Overall, it was a good night.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This post will probably repeat a prior idea. In fact most posts probably do so feel free to skip this one (and all of 'em). :)

I don't think it's San Diego in general; it's probably the United States, but I'm sure that not all of the world is affected especially parts of Africa where they can laugh over parts falling off a plane they are riding it. But, people really don't get the fact that bicycling is 100% FUN!

I come to work with a smile on my face and people look at me as if I am mentally ill.

Today, a co-worker mentioned that it was brisk for a bicycle ride--the usual privileged thing as if I had a choice of transportation. Note, that I am not opposed to privileged, I feel we should revel in it. We are super-duper rich right now. I just feel that we are kind of jerks for not acknowledging it.

We have a choice on how to get around, and it's wonderful. I truly believe I'm living in one of the best cities in the best countries in the world. I love it.

All I hear on the radio is doom and gloom.

Happy people need to stand up for ourselves--otherwise these idiots will try to drag us down.

Bicycling is fun; everyone should do it everyday.

Be happy people!
Really, we are doing great, and we don't even know it.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>My Commute II</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/02/07/my-commute-ii/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This continues from <a href="http://wp.me/pEodm-2m">My Commute I</a>.

When I go down Fairmount, I hear, I am so excited I often think of music.

When I first went down the hill, I thought of Blondie's song "Atomic" mainly about the part where Debbie sings, "Make it magnificent." And it was.

For a long time, I was thinking of the Bloodhoung Gang song, 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0sWN4FI1CQ">
"Ball's Out"</a>.

Though I often now meditate on my ride, I still think that this sums up what a ride down this hill is like. It's amazing how for a while, it's an ordinary city street lined with sidewalks and business, with crosswalks where cars stop for children and stoplights, suddenly, Fairmount blossoms into a highway.

The best part of the ride is the two traffic merges. In two places there are actually on ramps where one has to cross in front of a lane of motorists who are struggling to get onto the highway.

At first, I waited for traffic--"you're hair is beautiful". It was a rainy day, and I didn't want to slip or anything. But then I noticed that traffic wasn't going to stop, and I had to get to work. I just jumped out there with cars passing me on both sides. Scary, but a bit exhilirating. Plus, think, any of those cars can hit one another, too so it's not as nuts as it sounds.

The best part is that there is _always_ one good person out of the bunch who slows down to let me in. I always signal, realizing that our entire society runs on give and take. Here's a chance to allow someone to feel good all day while they brake, for a single second, to allow me to get by. Imagine, one second and two people feel good all day. I don't know how the other person feels, but I get a warm glow inside when people yield to me.

Between the first and second merges is a bus stop where people have seen me so often they will wave and smile. Also, there's a third on ramp where nobody ever gets on, but I check extra, everyday because the places where you get complacent tend to be the ones that really screw you.

Finally, there's an exit for bicycles only. It's kind of useless, and it has the model where bicycles have much harder terrain than motorists for some reason. 

[Who are these designers? I'd love to meet one and bicycle with them on something that they designed.]

This little ramp makes me feel good because here's something that's mainly for cyclists only, but not 100%. People still walk on this. Also there's sometimes a homeless guy who sleeps there. Another homeless guy, who's a fellow cyclist--hey!--sleeps off the trail. Both homeless are quite nice so I say "hi" to them daily.

Then I come down the hill where there's a stop light and a turn.

I'll talk about this in Part III.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Putting Me in My Place</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Sometimes, I actually feel like my comedy and advocacy goes too far, and I feel an urge to be put in my place.

Often, this comes in the form of detecting other people's pained expressions when the pathway between my tongue and the dark parts of my brain get connected at a party.

But usually--I know this is a shocker to people who know me well--I actually pull the emergency stop cord on a train of thought before it gets out into the wild. 

Yes, the mechanism in my head that keeps it all down is leaky, but it usually works.

Thus, I am actually going to repress a post of mine today.

I'll just give the general outline for it.

I was going to do a parody of the preprogrammed response to a cyclist's death by searching and replacing bicycle with SUV and cyclist with motorist. For the hackers out there here's the program:

#!/usr/bin/sed

s/cyclist/motorist/g
s/bicycle/SUV/g

# END PROGRAM

But I just the thought of doing such a thing made me sick to my stomach because I unlike the media, I have nothing against transportation systems that are not default for me. I find it to be vile--in a bad way--to take someone's death to push one's own agenda.

This insight has filled me with fresh revulsion to the way that the media portrays a cyclists death. 

I am going to certainly cancel my memorial service for the motorists who died. Nor will I have a drive of silence.

I will not express my outrage that the highways be closed, in the name of the families, so this doesn't happen again. I won't patronizingly tell parents not to put their child into a car because if the child dies, they can be tried for abuse.

I won't share statistics on how driving is one of the leading direct causes of death before it becomes a huge indirect cause of death.

Because that would be wrong and mean.

I will say that nobody knows why tragedy befalls families except for those of us who are blessed with religious beliefs that strengthen them in tough times.

I do know that to blame the victim is to injure a hurting family a second time for no reason.

And I know that we need to live our lives how we live them, and to really own our decisions. Some are good and some are bad, but we are doing the best that we can. 

And that's enough.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[At this point, things get interesting where "interesting" means I have to cross 3 lanes of traffic in order to get into the left hand turn lane. I usually wait until there's a red light and traffic does what I call "compaction". By compaction, I mean it when all the traffic stops and it backs up.

In most cases, this is pretty safe because all the cars are essentially parked, but one has to be careful because occasionally, a motorist may choose to drive sideways into the bike lane. Why they do this I don't know.

I mean, I do know that a motorist is supposed to enter the bike lane in order to make a right hand turn. That's why there's dotted lines there. This is a good idea, and it's safe for everyone because presumably the motorist is checking the lane before entering. Plus it avoids the legendary right hook.

In this case, however, there's no real bike lane. No shoulder, either, just a tiny space of road where the car's tires are not touching the cracked pieces of concrete that constitute a curb in these parts.

I can only guess that there's this uncontrollable urge in the motorist's mind that says, "must drive in gutter." Later on, I'll write a whole post on this topic something I call "gutter lust" where a motorist loves to drive as close to the edge of the road as possible at all times to the point of eschewing whole well paved lanes in favor of a the crumbly mess that often hangs next to a cliff or abuts a wall that's intended to keep an accident on one road from falling onto the road below.

Usually, though, if traffic is stopped, it's not too difficult to get over to the left hand lane. I have not gotten honked at once.

In fact, here's a place where cyclists shine because I think that they make the streets more efficient. My SO has joked about this phenomenon. It can best be seen as similar to the race track where a fake rabbit paces the dogs. Similarly, when the cars refuse to turn on a green arrow, I merely must go around the people who are content to sit while the light changes back to red. Once I enter their view, they transform into people who really, really need to go somewhere fast.

This always gives me a huge chuckle. If you see me laughing maniacally on my bicycle this might be one of the many reasons why. There are some jokes that will always be funny.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Note that right before I turn I see a giant advert which reads "Intense" which is exactly how I feel at this time.

The next part of the trip isn't as intense as bombing down Fairmount all the way to the valley, but it's intense for another reason.

Right after the turn, there's a shopping center with three entrances. What makes this so challenging is that everyone has a different style of dealing with this situation plus there's a lot going on.

In this case, a bicycle lane is actually a death trap because some of the motorists think that the bike lane is a line which they call pull up to see if there's traffic coming. Thus, the best move is to take the lane.

But people are turning right into the shopping center. So one must look back as to not run into them. But this is hard because people are pulling out in front of me.

Also, the right turns are all different. Some will wait behind me (best). Others want to pass me only to slam on their brakes. This is addressed in a prior post.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Thank you for your recent email to Councilmember Lightner about her support of bicycle commuting in the City of San Diego.  As her assistant to this issue, she asked me to respond and give you some of her thoughts on your inquiry.  Sherri is very supportive of bicycle commuting, and she has been and will continue to work to improve opportunities for bicycle commuting in her communities.  She understands the difference between recreational riding and commuting as you mentioned in your correspondence and will continue to work to improve access for all bicyclists.  Some of the things Sherri's done to support bicycle commuting include the following:

 

·         Sherri organized a recent stakeholder group meeting with the University City Planning Group, San Diego County Bicycle Coalition, Friends of Rose Canyon, SANDAG, City Engineering Staff and others regarding the section of the Coastal Rail Trail bicycle path, between Sorrento Valley and the Rose Canyon Bike Path, to move that project forward.

 

·         Sherri supports the construction of a bike path connection at SR-56 &amp; Sorrento Valley Road under I-5, as well as completing bike lanes on Carmel Valley Road to Sorrento Valley Road.  This is currently part of the North Coast I-5 Widening project.  We’re working with community members from Carmel Valley to try to get this project separated-out so it can be completed on a faster timeline than the I-5 widening.

 

·         Sherri continues to push for improvements to the I-5/Genesee interchange that will add bicycle lanes in both directions.  As currently designed (the EIR was released within the last several months) the new Genesee overcrossing includes bike lanes.  Here are some excerpts from the EIR:

 

“The Project would be designed to accommodate pedestrian and bicycle traffic, as well as vehicular traffic, within the Project corridor. The proposed overcrossing structure would include a Class II bike lane that is 1.8 m (6 ft) wide in each direction. The City of San Diego Bicycle Master Plan also identifies an existing Class III bike route along the shoulders of I-5 connecting Genesee Avenue and Sorrento Valley Road. The proposed interchange improvements would maintain this Class III bike route. Accordingly, the proposed improvements would include a bicycle and pedestrian link between the eastern and western sides of I-5 and would be consistent with planned multi-modal transportation facilities and goals in the Project area.”

 

“Both the Genesee Avenue and Voigt Drive overcrossings would be improved for bicyclist and pedestrian access and operations. The Genesee Avenue interchange would include a sidewalk that is 2 m (6.6 ft) wide on the north side of Genesee Avenue, bike lanes in both directions, striped/signalized pedestrian crossings and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliant pedestrian ramps at each intersection. The Voigt Drive overcrossing would include sidewalks and bike lanes. Existing free-right turns at the Genesee Avenue interchange would be removed to avoid conflicts with pedestrian and bicycle traffic.”

 

The full EIR for this project is available at http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist11/Env_docs/I-5_Genesee.pdf (PDF)

 

·         Sherri supports connectors at El Camino Real to the SR-56 bike path.  This is a project in progress, but that will take time to complete.

 

·         Sherri supports fixing the Black Mountain Road 56 bike intersection.  Again, this is something that is in progress.  The Rancho Penasquitos Planning Board approved a concept earlier this year, and the City is currently working with SANDAG and the Community for funding and implementation.  However, this will take time because of some differences in the Community’s and Caltrans’ visions for this intersection.  (Caltrans has a large role because of their land ownership at the intersection.)

 

·         Sherri constantly works to get cracks and potholes in roadways fixed quickly to improve riding surface and safety for bicyclists.

 

·         Sherri succeeded in pushing the City to work with UCSD to secure grant funding for their Bicycle Master Plan.  We’ll continue to support UCSD in their efforts at expanding their bike commuter programs.

 

·         Sherri is also incorporating some of the issues above into requests for Transnet funding through SANDAG that the City is applying for.

 

If you have any questions about the projects above, please don’t hesitate to contact me.  Also, if you have any thoughts about other improvements or issues in District One that you would like Sherri to know about, please don’t hesitate to pass them along.  Lastly, as Chair of the Land Use and Housing Committee (LU&amp;H) Sherri has the opportunity to have public discussions about land use and transportation issues at the committee.  If there are any policies or issues that you would like Sherri to consider adding to the agenda, please let me know.  I have cc’d Nika Bukalova, who is Sherri’s consultant for the committee.

 

Thank you very much for your email.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Sometimes when I leave on my bicycle, people tell me to "ride safely."

Although I do find it to be funny, being the gentleman that I am, however, my reply is, "thank-you."

But why is it funny?

Well, to paraphrase George Carlin, "That puts it all on me, doesn't it?"

Also, being an extreme optimist, I don't think that I need to do anything special to be safe on a bicycle. The whole "safe" thing inherently assumes that bad things happening are likely, and my mind refuses to accept this negative assumption because it results in suffering about events that haven't even happened yet.

Worrying about safety is one way that people have of destroying the enjoyment that they could have, and it squeezes all joy out of their world.

That's not to say that I don't pay attention while riding. One thing I do is try to pay attention to what's going on every second of my ride. 

Recently someone asked me if I ever spaced out while bicycling home. I have not. In fact, for me, it's nearly impossible to space out for more than a few seconds. 

Although it's not necessary for them to say, "be safe", I do realize that when tell me this, they are really expressing concern and love for me.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Hard Ball Sales Tactics</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/02/15/hard-ball-sales-tactics/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[A co-worker has a joke about me, he always asks me for help.

When I comply, he helps.

This is funny because I told him once that I don't help people.

He argued that I am always helping people.

I guess it depends on what you mean by "help".

If something is in my ability, and I am asked, nicely, I'll help someone just like everyone else.

But I do make an effort not to meddle in places where I am not wanted.

This reminds me of a Phil Dick (a science fiction author) quote where he said that his doctor told him to quit two things: drugs and helping others. He had a problem with meddling where he wasn't wanted, apparently.

Thus when I have the urge to meddle, I try to remember this.

Therefore, though I want people to experience the thrill and luxury of daily bicycle rides, I don't try to talk them in to buying a bicycle.

Though I'd be happy if someone, on their own, bought a bicycle and benefited from it, I can't really say that I want to be responsible for other people's decisions. It's enough for me to own what I choose to do for myself.

Someone described this philosophy as "live and let live" which I guess it is.

Therefore, I really don't like hard ball sales tactics on how one should get around. Oh, I don't like soft ball tactics either. In fact, I'm not much of a baseball fan. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I saw the book title: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Smartest-Guys-Room-Amazing-Scandalous/dp/1591840082">The Smartest Guys in the Room</a> and although I never read the book, I never forgot the title.

A cursory glance at the reviews shows that the title is probably meant to be ironic, but here my title is meant to be taken on face value.

It's a comment on how people often make their decisions. Although I admit to being a creature of emotion who makes his decisions primarily based on my whims, it's a dirty secret that I actually read statistics.

I haven't read anywhere anything that showed that cycling--even san helmet--is any more dangerous than motoring. 

This is funny because everyone I talk to seems to believe that getting on a bicycle on the mean streets of San Diego about as sane as putting your hand in the mouth of a shark. When I share the fact that I have been cycling as my only means of transport for over a decade, people just say that I am lucky.

Which is obvious as ad hoc argument at best which isn't so interesting, we all make mistakes. What does fascinate me to no end is how many of the people who claim that cycling is insanely dangerous are scientists, academics, and engineers.

I have found them all--as well as the rest of the slice of society I am lucky enough to come in contact with--deaf to both logic and statistics.

Last night while watching the best TV show ever: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_TV_Ruined_Your_Life">How TV Ruined Your Life</a>, I learned why. It's the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala">amygdala</a>. Of course!

Humans actually have two of these tiny organs nestled deep in their brains. While this clump of neurons is as important to one's humanity as any other part of their brain, it is actually one of the most primitive. 

I don't think that primitive, old, nor simple to always be bad, but in this case, the amygdala is the dumbest person in the room when it comes to making decisions.

However, it being part of the ancient limbic system, the center of emotions, it is easier than other parts of the human mind to manipulate which is why advertisers and politicians go for it.

Once someone is afraid, they are impervious to reason. This is why someone's educational background does little to defend them against the disingenuous.

This doesn't really bother me. I embrace my emotional heritage: my feelings are total assets.

However, I have been working with my feelings for a while, and I have managed to come to grasp, a little, with my sense of fear.

But it's not that I want to tell people how to think and feel, I just wish that they would think and feel with a wider range of expression. Those who are afraid, who watch television become extremely repetitive and boring: "bikes are dangerous oh my!" So my real motivation is to hopefully inspire more interesting conversational partners.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Fairness in Liability Correspondence</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Below is a letter I have drafted and sent to certain members of City Council of San Diego:

You have expressed interest in the government encouraging cycling. Studies show that the number one reason that people do not take alternative transportation is because of fear of automobiles. 

This fear is in part because the law doesn't motivate motorists to pay attention to the vulnerable. On the contrary, it seems that due to the current combination of laws and societal conditions, we are in a "vehicle arms race" where people feel the need to purchase larger vehicles just to protect themselves from other motorists who themselves are driving bigger vehicles so they feel safe.

This cycle of escalation benefits no one, and it creates an extra cost on every household which can exceed that of federal, state, and local taxes combined.

Perhaps we can break this vicious cycle?

When a car driver injures a pedestrian, the burden of proof is on the pedestrian for claiming compensation. It appears, our legal system does not favor the more vulnerable.

Car colliding with pedestrian or cyclist:

Hundreds of pedestrians and scores of cyclists get injured or killed by car drivers every year. The 2008 road casualty figures show that 332 pedestrians were killed in car/pedestrian collisions, and in car/cyclist collisions 52 cyclists were killed. In all 390 cases not one car driver was killed. Amongst pedestrians, cyclists and car drivers, it is clear that the car driver is the most likely party to inflict injury or death upon the others.

Cyclist colliding with pedestrian:

The 2008 road accident statistics by the Department for Transport show that one pedestrian was killed in a cyclist/pedestrian collision. It is clear when comparing pedestrians and cyclists, that the cyclist would be seen as the stronger party.

I find it very hard to understand that the burden of proof would be on the more vulnerable road user and not the one who is actually more likely to cause harm: inflicting pain and suffering through causing injury, or devastating families by causing death. All this does not seem fair to me.

If you think so too, could I please ask you to get in touch with the US Department of Transportation. It would be much appreciated if you could highlight to them, that we should subscribe to a more civilized system that is favoring the vulnerable.

Liability should therefore be considered on a fair and proportionate basis to provide legal protection to the vulnerable road user. This could be achieved by establishing a hierarchy of care where the burden of proof would always be on the user of the heavier vehicle (the party more likely to cause injury or death). This would show commitment of this Government to its agenda of societal and social fairness.

This principle of proportionality described above is in place in all but five European countries. The UK being one of them; the other four are Ireland, Romania, Cyprus and Malta.

Looking forward to hearing from you.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Golden Rules</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I really like the Golden rule--both of them actually: he who has the gold makes the rules and treat others as you want to be treated.

I find this useful to figuring out what is right and what is wrong. Another way of approaching this is to look at my behavior and to ask, if other people did this would I like them.

I find that this is true with cycling. The more people cycling the better; I don't care how or when or why. BMX, racers, commuters, hipsters, homeless, and well, that's about it, I love you all.

I love the motorists, too, but this kind of love wishes that they would smile more, be in better shape, and interact with other more on their commute.

Imagine being in a traffic jam and thinking, "I'm so glad all these people drove today. Isn't it wonderful that there are so many people who are wealthy enough to afford this?"

That's how I feel about cyclists.

Why don't more people cycle? There's lots of reasons which is funny I'm even writing about this because when I got into cycling, I never knew that I'd get so into psychology. A friend of mine told me that she thought it was funny that I was trying to read the mind of all the motorists around me. After a while, you can sometimes--big emphasis on sometimes--tell what they are going to do.

I was going to talk about the prisoner's dilemma and the energy of activation in chemistry as well as how catalysts lower it, but I'll leave that to another time. Let's stick with the morning bicycle love fest. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Councilmember IV</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Executive summary: Vote against Kevin Faulconer.

In previous stories, over a month ago, I have sent an email which asked whether government should encourage, discourage, or do nothing to promote bicycling as a form of commuting.

Only two council member have responded Sherri Lightner and Mari Emerald. They have both come out in favor of cycling. I met Todd Gloria on a bicycle ride, so he, too is overall encouraging of cycling as a mode of commuting.

If this were a political ad--which it is not--we'd cue the evil sounding music now.

I called Kevin Falconer's office to see what his people had to say. 

They say you should give people a happy sandwich so I can say that on the plus side, they answered the phone.

After I introduced myself, told her how many cycling commuters there are, which is .6% last time I checked, I asked the question, "does Kevin think that the government should encourage, discourage, or do nothing to encourage bicycle commuting?"

There was a pause. "I don't understand."

I repeated the question. "I don't understand."

I asked her how she got to work. "I don't understand."

"You drove."

Confusion on the other end.

I explained how the government actively encouraged motor vehicle use spending billions on its promotion and I asked her if the government should do the same for cycling.

"I don't understand." 

[I'll pause here and say, I'm really, really trying to be nice here, but this is as verbatim as I can make it. If Kevin wants to change his tune later, I'll put up a full retraction. I want to believe in the best of people.]

Me: "What if you could get to work by bicycle and to pick up your groceries by bicycle?"

Her: "I probably wouldn't because I have too many meetings."

[Again, this is a representative for a city council member who is fielding public phone calls. Yet she acts as if we are having a private conversation--as if I'm some kind of loon trying to get her to jump off a cliff or something.]

Me: "I don't mean you. I am just asking whether the government should encourage cycling commuting."

Her: "I don't know what he'd say."

OK.

Her: "Is your group local?"

Me: "I represent a couple of hundred thousand San Diegans."

Her: "Is your group local?"

[Note: I  have worked with people who are like this. They are very good at certain types of tasks, but I don't get on with them. They are extremely literal to the point where if you answer their question, but things are not spelled out 100% they don't get it right. They make good computer programmers and they are good with filing and nursing among other things. They are NOT good at working with people because people work takes creativity. I also got the feeling that she actually thought I was putting her on as if this were a prank call, and I got the tone of a woman who had an easy life where many people admired her as she seemed highly impatient with the task of answering an extremely simple question that required a single word.]

Me: Yes. Local to San Diego. 

Her: "I'll put you through to the media person."

Again, there was an answering machine.

The irony is that since he represents the beaches and downtown, there are actually quite a few people who commute by bicycle relative to the other areas. Yet, his spokesperson seemed unaware that bicycles even existed or they could do anything more than go in a circle on Fiesta Island. 

This also surprised me because the motorists in San Diego seem to be somewhat aware of how to deal with bicycles on the road so she had to have seen one. I am still scratching my head here. 

God bless her. May she be happy.

On the other side of the happy sandwich, I am officially half way done with my survey!]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Two Winds of Cycling</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Though I do strive to see the positive side of cycling, only, there's no doubt that many people look down on cyclists.

For some reason, we are both seen as wealthy elitists AND homeless people. We are seen as fitness buffs AND weaklings. We are seen as those who throw their own bodies away in traffic AND those who think only of ourselves as we block traffic.

The fact that a series of pejorative and yet contradictory statements are applied to cycling has not escaped me. It seems as if people are picking up whatever pieces of shit they can find with no rhyme or reason and tossing them at us, verbally.

How can a self-respecting person cycle?

For me, my religious beliefs sustain me. Though I'm not a practicing Buddhist, I do find Buddhist writings, as well as other holy books such as the Bible, to have a positive impact on my life.

Whenever people blame me, I realize that they are trying to sway my mind by what in Buddhism are known as the 
<a href="http://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/books-articles/articles/equanimity/">Eight Worldly Winds</a>.

In this case, they are "praise and blame". 

There are always those who are going to criticize your life. So if you give your life up for others to decide, you'll never be happy.

I spent the first quarter century of my life obsessed with pleasing others, and I was so depressed. Additionally, I found that I wasn't really an easy person to be around. 

Once I started to focus on what made me really happy did I find that I could think of others, too. Cycling is a big part of this.

I find, on the other hand, that cycling doesn't make many people happy, and I wonder why they continue to do it. I don't know this for sure, this is based on hearsay, because whenever I hear negativity regarding cycling, I immediately shut down that channel of communication.

There is too much information out there, and we needn't know everything. I have spent enough time studying and thinking of the pros and cons of cycling. After a certain point, we need to make a decision and stick to it no matter what.

I learned this from a recent president. Love him or hate him, he showed me that to vacillate is death. One must make a decision based on one's facts and be strong in the face of criticism. ]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Manufacturing Crisises</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Only when this is done did I realize that this has absolutely nothing to do with cyling. I could have shoe-horned something in, but that would be obvious and lame.

I have been thinking a lot about primitive societies lately, partly because I'm reading an excellent book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sex-Dawn-Prehistoric-Origins-Sexuality/dp/0061707805/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1298579417&amp;sr=8-1">Sex At Dawn</a> which postulates that our ancient ancestors are not as savage as we are now a days.

It's easy to guess why we have changed if you watch the eye-popping <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6718420906413643126#">Century of Self</a> (warning 4 hours) which shows how the advertising industry has sapped our ability to think for ourselves. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxQuHocBmxw">How TV Ruined Your Life</a> continues in the same vein.

All these thoughts in my head got me thinking of my own mid-life crisis, and whether it is innate to my species or whether it has its roots in my modern experiences. I am tending towards the latter especially since I am using the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nectar-Manjushris-Speech-Shantidevas-Bodhisattva/dp/1590306996/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1298579669&amp;sr=1-1">The Nectar of Manjushri's Speech</a> which is actually commentary on one of my favorite holy texts, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shantideva">Bodhicaryavatara</a> which is a poem that expounds on how one could properly practice Buddhism.

This book is a good antidote to the pain of aging because it helps me wrestle with the questions of what I fear with aging which is loss of youth, vigor, and life's pleasures that come with the package.

Studies that show that older people are happier were unhelpful. 

However, when I figured out what I was really clinging to, and I started to work on getting rid of that, I started to get better.

My main difficulty with these types of strong emotions is that they form a cloud over my usual preternatural insightful powers.

Now, I feel much better so I realize that my feelings are not important. What's really important is sticking with the practice, acting with compassion, and treating my wife like the princess she is.]]></content:encoded>

I think recognizing that I'd never be great or famous got rid of a lot of fear I had of growing old. Aging is unimportant if there are no preset goals to be met by a certain age. There is only experience to be gained. 

As for the fear of dying, actively plotting suicide (when I was a teen, readers - have no fear) allowed me to come to terms with my own mortality, my fears of dying and my insignificance in this world.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Last night, I heard a story that made my blood run hot.

A friend of mine, Jay, was viciously attacked on Broadway St. while riding his bicycle.

I wasn't totally surprised to hear this because there are a number of insane people in the world, and for all of them, the state has seen fit to put into their hands a deadly weapon, plus it provides a pile of get out of jail free cards. 

"It was an accident."

"I wasn't looking for bicycles."

"The bicycle shouldn't have been there."

However, of all the people attacked, Jay was one of those who deserved it the least.

He's always a happy guy, and always kind who feels a strong bond to his community. He wishes to reach out to all of us including the homeless. 

Of course, the attacker didn't know any of this. He could have, of course. If he had stopped to chat, Jay would have warmed up to him.

Instead, the motorist chose violence.

I wasn't there, but I can speculate why.

Jay is a guy that Gretchen calls a <a href="http://www.happiness-project.com/happiness_project/2010/10/quiz-are-you-a-tigger-or-an-eeyore-plus-a-few-points-to-consider.html">Tigger</a>. As she states, Tiggers often piss those of us who are not so happy off. 

It's not so bad to be a miserable bastard if we feel that everyone is as depressed as us, but it really rubs salt in the stigmata when people actually smile and enjoy their lives.

Jay does both. All the time.

He must have really t-ed off this motorist because apparantly the driver jumped from his vehicle and tried to punch Jay.

At this point, I could just as reflexively and viciously attack this motorist's character, but I won't.

In Buddhism there's something known as afflictive emotions that cloud one's thoughts, and anger is a big one. I have worked out most of my anger issues, but I do realize what a huge drug this is. The power can be intoxicating, but the hang over is hell.

We don't know what this motorist went through. Thus, I'll say a little prayer for him: "May he be happy."

I think we should all forgive someone's mistakes.

On the other hand, I am not waiting for Divine Judgement, Karmic Retribution, nor the Invisible Hand to correct the imbalance created by this motorist's total lack of humanity and proper judgement.

On the contrary, I want the Justice System in this world to dispense justice.

I trust that the police had all ready apprehended this person and he is being held for bail which according to google should be about <a href="http://www.marylandbailbondsblog.com/2010/10/baltimore-celebrity-out-on-bai.html">$50,000.</a>

Yes, I am optimistic. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Friendship Reborn</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[My SO and I had a friend who cycle commuted in San Diego, but then she had to move out of town to New Mexico.

Her name is Dacia, and I just knew her as just another cycling commuter until we had a chat this last weekend.

The first thing we discovered was how she liked living in a desert community near a college town.

She said that at first, she didn't like it, but now she has adjusted.

First of all, she likes to wake up and see nothing but blue sky and mountains. Second, she loves to smell fresh desert air.

I was happy to hear this because it expressed a good attitude on life.

She was also happy to be close to her family which I thought was excellent especially as she was able to take care of her nieces and nephews.

As always when I hang out with a fellow cyclist, there was a lot we had in common. 

For example, she, too, had decided to do without children.

She, too, had gotten lost on a long ride.

It could go on and on.

One really interesting thing I learned was how offensive it can be for white people to copy non-whites then present themselves as "gangsta".

The response from the community ranges from amused to angry. 

We also talked about how some white people were in denial that racial differences exist at all. They do for hair and skin care for example.

Finally, she told me she is from the ghettos of Los Angeles!

For me, gangs were always like a cartoon on television, but now I learned a few basic things about how the members communicate by signs and calls. Note, this is back in the 1990's. 

I learned how gangs and ghetto life were way more fascinating, dangerous, and detailed than I had ever imagined.

Though I often lived in poor neighborhoods in Philadelphia, I realize now that I had not experienced the terrain the same way that I would have if I had been born there.

I even learned that many people considered riding a bicycle "too white" which is something for cycling advocates to chew on.

By the end of the night, my mind was full of fascinating stories and interesting anecdotes from the dessert to cycling to the wild hoods in LA. 

I can't wait till Dacia comes back in a few weeks. Hopefully, we'll talk some more.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Some people who know me well know that my life is basically about self-improvement. 

Why, I don't really know because I'm going to die anyway.

Probably because it keeps me happy, and also because there's nothing better to do.

This week, I'm working on my attachments.

Obviously, as a cyclist, I am highly attached to the notion of improvement in our cycling infrastructure in San Diego. I often hear complaints about how badly cycling sucks here.

As I said before, though the infrastructure sucks, I don't think that cycling here sucks. I know it can be better, but I try not to imagine. Rather I spend my time enjoying what we have.

I usually attribute this way of thinking as samsara which is wrong because samsara actually means the wandering through the stages of life. When I think of samsara, I think of someone's yearning for the world to be different than it is. The opposite of that is obviously enlightenment which is ever so far away.

In fact, I just came out of a mental storm which left me feeling totally hopeless.

I am inspired by Pema Chodren's statement, "Abandon Hope" where she explains a similar concept. The world isn't going to ever be perfect nor will we so we should stop hoping for that and just accept what we have here.

I love this idea!

It ties in with the notion that one should think of the past as being perfect. We should accept this how it is and move on.

Yes, I had a great bicycle ride this morning.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Ride the Divide</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I like bicycling movies especially those about races as much as the average motorist likes to watch NASCAR movies such as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0415306/">Talladega Nights</a>. Actually since it grossed almost 150 million, which is double the budget, I probably like biking movies a bit less.

I do like to see bicycles on film, but mainly in a normal context like on <a href="http://www.hbo.com/html/error/browser_message_a.html?return=http://www.hbo.com/flight-of-the-conchords/index.html">Flight of the Conchords</a>.

However, I do recommend <a href="http://vimeo.com/9654326">Ride the Divide</a>. 

One of the treats I got when watching this movie was it was one of the first times I had ever driven through Hillcrest. 

I was happy to get there in comfort, ease, and speed.

Then I realized that a lot of the speed increase got wiped out when we rode around looking for parking. Hint for a city, San Diego has way abundant parking in many people's opinion there is so much that it detracts from a decent experience. Yet there was still trouble finding it due to a well known phenomenon that I call "chasing one's tail."

Once we found parking, we rushed over to buy tickets. I literally bought the 3rd to last ticket from my friend Special K.

Then there was an announcement by a guy who looked like a steel haired rock star about mountain biking. It was nice.

When the movie started, at first I was disappointed that it was about racing.

The thing I usually don't like about racing is that it creates an attachment to an outcome. What I mean is that the people rode through the most gorgeous spots, and they had a big chance for self-fulfillment. In this particular race, the people seemed to take advantage of it to an extent.

Another thing that struck me is that this type of touring was almost an experiment in solitary confinement. The people complained about being lonely, missing loved ones etc. I can totally see the feeling, and the thought of such an adventure fills me with dread so I will probably not do it.

Also, the physical exhaustion really hurts one's judgement. It makes people meaner and pettier. In this movie, the people seemed to stay at a fairly even keel which shows how strong they all were. The main thing that kept cropping up is that people quit, but they didn't give reasons which were conguent w/ that decision. They mainly said that they were lonely, and that it is beautiful, but it's more of the same everyday and they all ready overcame a lot so what's the point. 

What's the point? To finish the race that they dreamed about all their lives. Otherwise, why bother at all?

I say this as someone who really does not see the point, but if I decide to commit to this, I'm going to want to finish. This is what makes me realize how tough this race is. These are really tough people, and they wanted to quit. I can't imagine what strain they were under.

To give one an idea of how strong they were, many rides were 100+ miles per day. The terrain was up and down, seven times Everest in all. 

For me, on regular roads with few hills and a light headwind, I could do about 50 miles on a daily basis. Sixty is pushing it. The most I ever did was eighty and I left at midnight and rode all day. I could not sustain this pace. 

Yet the winner, one year did 165 miles on the average per day. These people are totally amazing riders.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Building With Good Friends</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Last weekend, I helped some friends build an oven out of clay and sand.

It was an amazing experience. This style of oven is ideal for baking bread, and it requires very low heat.

For the first time in my life, I got a taste of how it must feel to be an Amish person working on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barn_raising">barn raising</a> together.

In fact, one of my friends said that he would love to do this everyday to build a house. I think that would be fantastic.

For me, the best part was the sensual feel of the clay and water on my feet when I got into the garbage can that held that mixture.

Of course, the stupid movie which I never even saw, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8raWmec0WB8">Ghost</a> kind of ruined clay for me. :)

Of course, the day consisted of more than just dancing around on top of a mixture of clay and sand.

We also spoke about food, bicycles, and how to have more humanity in the world.

It was amazing to be in the same room with people who were all well read and on the same page.

It's not about feeling like I am better than others, but there is a whole bunch of scientific research done by people who truly would like their world to be a happier place for themselves and others, and it seems like only a small portion of us are reading it even though much of it is publicly funded.

It's not even a political issue, but a universal issue. All of us have a common humanity with similar emotions whether we live in NYC, CHP, or San Diego, we're more similar than we are different.

The topics ranged from the new (to me) <a href="http://www.thepaleodiet.com/faqs/">Paleo Lifestyle</a> to parking lots to famous Indian poets to menu design to <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/9977/comments/?page=3">prostitutes with MFAs.</a>

Amazing people and an amazing time.

We finally started talking about one of my current obsessions which is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapulines">chapulines</a> which they said they will help me prepare if I can find a supplier.

Amazing times to come.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[After the shopping center, things calm down for a while. There's a straight away with a bicycle lane which runs along the fast paced 4 lane road with traffic in both directions. The road is completely flat.

This lasts for a glorious half a mile.

Next there's the right turn past 24 hour fitness which has a transit stop and bicycle boxes. I often actually do take the left lane as this point since it keeps me out of a door zone, sometimes people dart out into the street, and there's zero traffic in this left lane.

&nbsp;

It's a bit scary, though, because I have to climb a hill where there's zero visibility over the top. The hill is really short which makes things worse b/c it doesn't slow down motor traffic. At the top, right when I can barely see over the crest of the hill--yes, I am kind of anal when it comes to safety despite my claim to the contrary--I turn left.

&nbsp;

Now I am in a slow street which leads to the stadium parking lot. This road is about a tenth of a mile and it usually has at least on car coming in or out of it.

&nbsp;

Next I pass what looks like government housing projects, but on google maps, there are many nice swimming pools. Only in Southern California!

&nbsp;

Then I go beneath an overpass where I come out past an area that is usually bicycle only though it's open during special events such as when they sell cars in the stadium parking lot or during football games.

&nbsp;

And I'm in Qualcomm Stadium Parking Lot.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Why I Want To Eat Insects</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[It all started with some family conversations about oil.

&nbsp;

In 2003, when we invaded Iraq, my SO and I sat in a bar playing Quizzo in West Philly. One of the teams was: "My truck doesn't run on peace."

&nbsp;

Though I opposed the war because I thought that it was based on reasons that were untrue, and I felt that eight years later, we'd be deeply in debt as a country, and still at war, I loved the provocative name for so many reasons.

&nbsp;

Flash forward to years later where the price of gas goes to over four dollars. People went from mocking me for cycling to hailing me as prophet and a genius.

&nbsp;

This didn't change me much as I still cycled for fun and profit no matter how much fuel was.

&nbsp;

At the same time, as an experiment, we kept the heat to a minimum in a freezing winter and kept the lights off at nights. It was really fun, and we slept better. I meditated better with a water bottle (I had no job at the time). We were happy with minimal electricity which would mirror super high prices.

&nbsp;

By candle light, I read books about oil with titles like<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Partys-Over-Fate-Industrial-Societies/dp/0865714827">The Party's Over</a>.

I didn't talk about the end of oil too much with others because I didn't want to be seen as criticizing my friends who owned cars--most of them did. I don't look down on anyone for how they get around be it a Hummer or pogo stick so rest easy.

It took a few more years to make the whole notion controversial when Bush said we were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addicted_to_oil">addicted to oil.</a> I had trained myself to be so socially correct that when he said it, _I_ thought he sounded a bit like a left wing loon.

With all that knowledge and history my SO did experiments with weaning ourselves from oil. We knew that in reality it was impossible, and as she said even if it _was_ possible for us, this is only because of our privileged which allows us to float on a raft of cheap oil while we float to the environmentally friendly shore. People in other countries need to deforest just to feed their cooking fires. In a sense environmentalism is a privilege--one I wish to share.

We knew that food was connected with oil usage so we struggled to eat locally. We had also heard the joke that roaches would inherit the earth. Plus I was a big fan of <a href="http://www.travelchannel.com/TV_Shows/Anthony_Bourdain">Food Adventure shows</a> especially with Bourdain. So I was no stranger to taking changes in my diet.

Things all came together when I read in the excellent book, _Sex At Dawn_, where so called primitive people got fat by eating insects. 

I talked to a friend from Columbia, and she told me that she used to eat ants. Later, I discovered chopulinas which are served in Oaxaca and Mexico, DF and possibly Tijuana. 

Another friend of mine offered to have them professionally prepared if I found them live in San Diego. 

The search is on. If anyone knows where to get these cooked or raw please let me know.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[One thing that keeps coming up over and over again when discussing cycling is safety.

Long time readers all ready know that I despise safety.

This often confuses people because it is assume that safety is this 100% pure thing that costs nothing. It is the trump card that ends any political debate. People who love safety say inane things like "you can't be too safe" and "if it only saves one life."

The problem is that safety is often fake. Some of the things we have done in the name of safety make us more dangerous like buying big trucks that tend to roll when not driven properly.

Also, safety is not without cost, in fact, I think it's safe to say that we are paying way too much for a false sense of safety and they not even feeling better about ourselves. What a waste!

However, when people discuss bicycle safety with me, I usually am reluctant to let them know that I consider cycling safer than driving. For one thing, people are not going to believe me, and thus I have taken step one in undermining my credibility. No good comes of safety debates, and I find people who base their lives on statistics to be deluded bores.

No, the number one reason that I don't argue when people tell me that cycling is dangerous is that I desperately want them to believe that I'm a badass.

I don't know when badass started to be a bad thing. If you look at the average male around San Diego, they look like seasoned gang members, but when you have a conversation with them, they are nice guys just like me. 

So there is still some edge that people crave. 

I'll put this out there that I am certainly not a badass nor am I unusually brave.

I just grew up learning that one doesn't go around admitted that one is afraid of things. If I don't want to do something, I won't, but I don't go up to every motorcyclist and tell them stupid shit like, "I hope you don't get run over!" and "You're a lunatic for riding that badass motorcycle."

I don't question people's lives because it would make me look like a tool. But also because I don't go around freely professing that I'm a super-wimp who needs to have the latest data sheets in order to make a decision on anything.

I say that one should just get out there and to take some risks.

But you might die! Then what?

We are all going to die. 

The real risk we are taking is in NOT LIVING.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Gratitude for Halcyon for Frog and Toad</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Every time it rains, like last week, the sand, like that of a sand castle rolls down the hill and onto just the bicycle path Fairmount Road.

Every time a crew places reflective, wooden barricades in the spot which would push cyclists a bit further into the 55 MPH road. 

Lucky for me, a strange cyclist just ahead of me dumped his bicycle in the sand and walked along the side of the road like he were a model on a catwalk and he pushed the barriers out about three inches into the road. When I got there, I was able to ride safely home.

As I rode by, I shouted thanks. He waved a single finger at me. 

At first, I thought he was giving me the bird, but then I saw that his fingertip was purple. I'd have taken him for a goth except that his other fingers were unpainted. Plus fresh blood gushed from the tip.

Only later did I realize that in his excitement to secure the sad joke that we call a "bike lane", he got his fingers caught in the sign.

A few days later, I found out that some good souls, again not associated with the city, rode over with shovels and bags. They completely cleared the lane and then they shored up the side with bags packed from the sand that they just cleared. 

Saints, the lot of them.

The wonderful City of San Diego, meanwhile, has still not managed to clear a few inches of dangerous dirt on the bicycle path though, of course, the rest of the stadium parking lot is totally clear.

I propose, as a budget measure to the city, that the bicycle lanes get turned over to volunteers. The city could save a lot of money if they would just sign a paper promising not to put us in jail if we fix up the city.

Overall, though, I am grateful to a city which allows good people to volunteer at a risk to themselves. It gives us the opportunity, all us, to be little heroes.

Maybe next time, I'll help out the strange guy with the purple bird.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[There's a terrible disease striking America and it affects the people I love the most, cyclists and slow fooders.

It's based on BS advertising that's out there to profit from you by making you life a crappier life so they can sell you things.

Their weapons are words--weasel words. 

These aren't ordinary words that describe things in the ordinary world, but rather constructions that pack in their own neurosis and judgment in order to trick and to manipulate you.

Don't believe the hype. The antidote is available.

One of them is "elitist". 

In reality this word means nothing, but like Queer Nation, it's a word I want to take back. I will own it.

Basically, it plays on the--usually--liberal tendency for leveling and equality. It tries to hijack well meaning humility to use against the humble.

When someone calls me an "elitist", it's just as if someone is called any other ignorant BS by a racist. 

That is, as soon as I hear the word "elitist" I walk away and NEVER listen to that person at all. If I am reading, I toss the article away. 

Done.

I _could_ sit and listen to the nonsense all day, but I choose not to just as I choose not to smash my own hands in a door. Because there's no point, and it's harmful to me.

Basically, this word doesn't bother me because I am highly arrogant.

Thus I  greet accusations such as "everyone live like that" and "you think you are better than everyone else" with sage nodding.

I know.

I _really_ love to hear that someone can't possible live in So. Cal w/o out a car b/c I love to do the impossible.

Own your life.

Don't apologize.

Don't explain.

Don't justify.

Don't placate.

Just ride your bicycle and smile.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Horror Movie Morality</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/horror-movie-morality/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[My wife and I were talking about horror movies the other day.

I used to not like horror movies, but when I started to work on my fears, especially the fear regarding dying on a bicycle, I have stopped being afraid of them. Also, I did a little research on them, and I realized that they are more than just random killing--though they often have that--but they also have some very cool and clear patterns such as the final girl, the one who lives to kill the killer.

Usually she is somewhat pure which enables her to survive.

This is when we got into the whole idea of US horror movies mirroring some of our inner anxieties regarding morality especially sex, but it includes all kinds of fun.

To paraphrase the video shop guy in _Scream_, "Don't do drugs and don't have sex because you will die."

Of course, both topics have one thing in common, and it's not that they are bad, but they are fun. They were also campaigned against relentlessly in my youth. I'm still a bit angry and resentful because I feel that I had been denied some harmless fun which delayed my personal growth quite a bit.

I think that this is related to cycling in that cycling is also fun, and like sex and drugs, it's a kind of fun that's seen as imposing a burden on society for the benefit of the few. The old Christian--and horror movie--morality goes that for every bit of fun we have, there's a price to be paid which is why I feel that people are quick to blame a cyclist for their death even if the motorist is at fault.

I'd argue that with great power comes with responsibility, but that's a separate discussion.

In fact, our rush to blame the bicyclist first or BBF, to me has actually become pretty much comedic. Life's too short to be eternally outraged. We had our good rant and anger, and now we can move on.

It reminds of me Dave Chapelle's routine where cops would kill blacks in DC where he was growing up and to absolve themselves of all blame and investigation, they'd just sprinkle crack on that person.

Now a days, they a cop could run someone over and they would not be held accountable if they just dropped a bicycle onto that person. 

In fact, this morning, I noticed that they had orange cones and huge signs blocking the bike lane on my way to work. I thought, "cool", because seldom do I have the opportunity to ride with so much protection.

I love the notion of us having care and gratitude for those who pave our streets because we owe it to them for a big luxury in our lives. I totally agree that fines should be double or quadruple for hitting a construction worker.

Then I thought, I ride up this hill everyday. There's nobody looking out for me. I know that, as per horror movie morality, chose to cycle, but since we don't live in Soviet Russia to a degree, the construction workers chose their jobs, too.

I am not thinking of NOT protecting the workers, but this thought gave me pause.

For most of the hill, I didn't even ride behind the pretty orange force field because I had to hit the button and the button only works on the opposite side of the street and the light doesn't activate for cyclists and there were no cars and this is one more way that San Diego says she loves me each time I cycle.

So I did the next best thing and tried to cut over when it was safe. But it was only safe on the near side so I got stuck in the--huge and safe--middle lane. For a while, everyone just rode on each other's bumpers until some nice person let me in. I could tell because he honked sweetly and gave me room.

Once ensconced behind an orange wall of cones, I waved. He waved back and I saw that he was a co-worker who said he would hit me if he saw me in the street. He had changed for the better!

Miracles happen everyday.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I don't think I compared cycling to horror movies, but rather the morality used to justify the callousness of society towards people who die on their bicycles.

Comparing things that have nothing in common is a literary device known as metaphor. 

For some reason there seems to be a decline of adults who get metaphors and other colorful and creative forms of expression.

Or perhaps there was always a subset who have this difficulty.

I believe that such people tend to be more concrete thinkers who do well with hands on work as well as literal written work, but have trouble with abstract thinking. I'm not sure, but it is interesting.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Parking Rage</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Last night, some of my wonderful friends had me and some other people over for pizza.

The pizza was amazing with not only homemade crust, but also a homemade white sauce. Plus it was Irish pizza with potato and meat that tasted like corned beef. 

Perfect!

We watched a great movie called <a href="http://www.theparkinglotmovie.com/">The Parking Lot Movie</a> which detailed what happens if a parking lot is run by grad students.

The language in the movie was stunning not unlike Charlie Brooker, but with an American twist.

The thing that really stunned me about the movie was how angry most of the motorists were and also how cheap they were. Some would waste time over forty cents which to me is insane as I have that much on the bottom of my pannier. I bet if I crawled on the floor of my house, I could dig up forty cents quicker than the time the lady in the movie took to whine about how unfair it all was.

One of the characters in the movie said that he hated all motorists which I thought was totally unfair because I love motorists. In fact, many of my best friends are motorists, though I must admit, I wouldn't want my daughter to marry one. Just joking, I can't have a daughter. :)


Anyway, I thought about the whole notion of the angry driver, and I think that the situation is highly hilarious. 

I used to be naive enough to think that cycling was all that was needed to make people happy, but that's obviously not true because my SO informs me that there are plenty of angry cyclists out there, too.

Cycling does make me happy, I think. I wonder how my alternate universe self, who is a motorist, feels.

Anyway, I am of two minds about the angry motorist. On one hand, I like to believe that deep down, our true nature, as humans is radiant and beautiful. I know that this is controversial and may even seem horrible because I see ALL people as wonderful deep down inside and I disagree with the crazy notions of American horror where Evil is a real thing lurking inside of each of us. I see evil more as dirt that covers up our lovely diamond of a mind.

I keep hearing people argue for the deep seated evil which is brought up when people are allowed to cover their couches with glass, plastic, and steel and to move around really fast.

Apparently, when it comes time to store that couch, theirs a huge believe that this real estate should be free. I probably said this many times, but it freaks me out that people who think that poor people belong on the streets or worse feel entitled to free real estate for their machines. Kind of mean.

Also, I spoke to a friend, and a motorist, who echoed ideas of evil that comes out when motoring. In fact, she even admitted that she became evil, too, when driving, which made me really admire her on a whole new level. Honesty of that level is very rare.

So I have a conundrum. Should I believe my happy fantasy and see people as radiant and beautiful inside or should I realize the evidence of my senses and that we are all greedy, petty, mean, cold, and very hard deep down. Where forty cents is a cause for demeaning another person, destroying their property, and then fleeing at great risk to everyone else in the world as they speed off?

I don't know.

For now, I'm going to cling to my happy dream.

My glasses are clear, the roses are implanted in my pupils.

  <title>Instant Justification</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[In a hotel room, in the middle of the US, my SO and I watched an interesting documentary about the Autobahn which was the German precursor to the US Highway System.

Basically, the entire idea of highways was a new one, not thought of before.

One of the main limitations of automobiles was that there was too much stuff in the way for them to go really, really fast?

Why did they want to go so fast? There are a lot of reasons, but some of the best ones were to break speed records. Race car drivers drove on the empty Autobahn...until a few crashed and burned. They put an end to all that and just opened them up to vehicle traffic.

The problem was there wasn't enough traffic. Barely anyone rode on it to justify its existence.

The German government, seeing that the "Will of the People and the Invisible Hand of the Market" had spoken, and the smelly, noisy, dangerous Autobahn was torn up. Seeing this failure, no other country built a highway system ever again.

Just kidding.

Instead the German government did everything except bribe people to drive on the highway including making much cheaper cars and other incentives.

So the next time someone tells you that the freeways are a response to people's wants and desires, you can tell them the whole long spiel above until they nod off. Hey, sometimes knowledge fails to fit into sound bites. :)

No, the freeway was and still is a result of massive government intervention. I don't think that this is wrong, but we need to realize reality before we compare apples to apples.

What I'm saying--since this is a bicycle blog--building infrastructure and trying to get people to enjoy cycling is no more or less social engineering and government intervention than the way we get around now.

Only cycling has lots of advantages especially in that it doesn't kill so many people. I guess it's not universal. I mean some people _like_ killing other people. I am open minded so I'm not going to try to push my beliefs on others.  Jokes, only jokes here. :)

Anyway, I think it's funny how when a new bicycle lane is built which goes from nowhere to nowhere else without the rest of the supporting infrastructure, we get complaints that people don't use it.

That's not only a double standard, but no standard at all.

We don't tear up vehicular roads when the usage falls below a certain level. I have seen roads with not a single car on it for miles, but I failed to see the bulldozer traveling behind me to get rid of it.

I can point out a road that is bigger than the main drag in Philadelphia that goes to a parking lot where there's barely any cars, ever. Should we start tearing up these empty parking lots? 

No? Why?

Because they are going to be used in the future.

So when people argue that a bike lane is not used, the proper answer isn't, "yes it is." The right answer is, "so what?"

We live in a market economy and each area needs to be segmented to consumers. We have 50 types of cheese in a grocery store why don't we have more than one mode of transportation?

I know that you can bicycle some places and you can take public transportation other places, but I think that to be equitable you should split the budget in quarters otherwise, we are forcing the market's hand.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Making Converts?</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/03/23/making-converts/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I know that a lot of people find this hard to believe, but while I practice bicycle advocacy, I do so in the same way that the Roman Empire, in its last days, fought battles: if you don't keep expanding, you will shrink. Thus, I continue to expand bicyclists rights just so mine don't get taken away. I don't want to save the world or anything like that, and I definitely don't try to convert people. In fact, when people copy me, I feel really strange which is why I'd probably make a terrible cult leader.

I recall the other day answering questions about my cycling habits to a co-worker, and later on, I overheard her telling someone else that I was "trying to get her to ride her bicycle to work." I didn't think that my assertion that my ride to work wasn't "completely hellish, but in fact, kind of fun" is equivalent to "telling her to ride her bicycle to work" but I've been wrong before.

So let me straighten things out now, as a lover of all humanity, I love you whether you ride a bicycle or not. In fact, if you drive, and you are going my way, can I catch a ride? :)

However, there are many people out here who are getting a different message.

For example, I talked to a guy today who saw me ride. He asked, so I told him my commute, and he was a bit impressed. This is funny because each time people hear about the hills I have to do, I guess a bulb goes off in their heads and they realize that their own commutes would be cake because they always talk about how they could actually ride their bicycles to work.

Note that in all of this, I am mostly a passive observer. I answer questions honestly. But the only real contribution I have is my enthusiasm.

When they mention exercise, money saved, or the environment, I always let them know that it's also fun.

Them: Even climbing Fairmount?

Me: I always have fun.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Usurper </title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[In a writing how to book, I recalled that there were universal ways of making a character unlikable. One of the easiest is to make that character a usurper.

I found this to be really strange in the US where people generally, believe that we are all equal as this would make a usurper unthinkable.

Alas, even in the land of the free, there are hierarchies and thus a chance for a usurper.

What is a usurper?

It's someone who takes a role which is not assigned to him. It originally comes from the times when there was a king, and the usurper was someone who had no shot at becoming a king, but claimed that right for himself anyway. In this case, it's pretty easy to see why this person makes us angry. He's taking something that doesn't belong to him, kind of universal.

Plus, we all like to respect our leaders, but if our leader isn't legitimate then it confuses the whole notion of leadership.

The best example of a usurper today, is in talks where someone keeps interrupting the main speaker or where they ask too many questions or press their own point too forcefully. Even if the usurper is smarter than the main speaker, we came to see the speaker and someone else disrupting it is a usurper no matter what they have to offer. 

I have seen talks where the speaker admits that the usurper has a lot to offer and she listens to her usurper with alacrity. Still, the audience chafes at this unasked for interruption. Why doesn't this blow hard usurper shut up so we can get on with the main speech?

Similarly, the notion of the usurper is one of the main reasons why people hate cyclists. You can tell when they say things like, "Cyclists don't belong on the streets." 

It matters not at all that there's no where else for us nor does it matter that it actually is legal for us to ride on the streets. They see us as illegitimate and that's that.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Command Responsibility</title>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I like the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_responsibility">Command Responsibility</a> which means that the leader of a group is responsible for things that people below him do. It's not enough for a leader to say, "I didn't know."

Since many leaders in the US apparantly argue in court, today, that they "didn't know" and they seem to think that their ignorance is something that should get them out of their crimes. I think that this is doubly bad. They should pay for the original crime, and also pay back their salary for fraud as they didn't do the job they said that they would do. 

But I'm not a lawyer.

In the same way, I see a cyclist as the master of her domain. Whatever decisions she makes on the road are up to her. Thus, I don't second guess a cyclist's decisions nor to I bother pointing out that in some districts in some people's opinions, she may be "breaking the law." Oh my.

Anyone who cycles on the streets for more than five minutes will realize that the streets are not set up for our safety nor ease of use. In fact, if I were more paranoid, I would think that an engineer somewhere went out of her way to try to get me killed. I don't feel that way; I realize that there are constraints on any plan and often cyclists are the ones who are, literally, the first ones under the bus. :)

Thus, there is little reason for a cyclist to obey the letter of the law if it is putting her life in danger. 

The laws are made to keep people safe and happy, and when they violate that principle, they are obstructing us, and sometimes even killing us.

This is why I am so upset when people obsess over cyclists following traffic laws. The real question a compassionate person would have is, "What can I do to make the cyclists happier and safer?"

Probably honking at them, lecturing them, and harassing them isn't the right answer.

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[You make the point that we as cyclists are more often than not left to fend for ourselves and that we need not obey the law if it puts us in peril.  I do not disagree.  

However, I believe that we as cyclists more often break the law for the same reasons that motorists break the law, to avoid inconvenience or delay.  In both cycling and car cultures this is culturally acceptable.  Car drivers go a few mph over and bikers ride through stop signs.  

I should add that many of these stop signs were placed as traffic calming measures to keep cars from driving too fast through residential areas.  Bikers choose these routes because they are calmer and bikes do not pose a danger in the same way speeding cars do, so there is usually little harm in rolling through the stop sign.

I believe that car drivers are frustrated with cyclists because of a misunderstanding of cultural differences.

I think that the idea of "command responsibility" needs to be applied to those who have the final say in road design.  They should be held accountable for making road conditions safe and practical for all users.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Wow, nice detailed comment; there's a lot here.

I don't think we disagree on any major points.

By allowing cyclists to be responsible for themselves, I didn't mean that motorists nor planners should be irresponsible.

I am just responding to the voices, over the years, who, as cyclists themselves, sought to demonize a certain segment of the population aka homeless and bmx riders.

I wanted to beam a little love in everyone's direction--including the critics--but I wanted to do so in an informed way.

Your comments make me feel like I have, mostly, succeeded.

So to sum up my summary: I don't judge. :)]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[People, sometimes, ask me why I ride my bicycle in the street. Their tone suggests that I do this out of spite for them as motorists, which makes me laugh.

Why would I want to put my ass out into traffic, unless I was some kind of sick adrenaline junkie, which I kind of am, come to think of it. :)

Still, for most of my bicycle rides, I'd prefer an nice, idyllic, QUIET bicycle path preferably so that I can't see automobiles and to protect them from seeing me.

But alas, this small amount of money--a fraction of our highway system--to give the sixty plus percent of us who said YES to bicycling to work, a safe place to ride.

As an aside, I never saw something that more people wanted outside of free health care than bicycle lanes which the majority of us wanted, but we were totally denied. Heck, they even tried to make us feel bad for wanting it, but I make zero apologies for my desires.

But no, we don't live in Copenhagen. Which I feel should be our new rallying cry and even our raison d'être.

That is, whenever anyone asks for any kind of sane infrastructure, like the kind of stuff that people all over the world have and in Copenhagen they have the most, we are told, "San Diego is different."

They mean that in a positive way, but hearing it over and over again makes it seem like we are differently abled. Which I think is mean because if you talk to an average San Diegan, they are quite kind and intelligent. 

The whole notion that we can't have something because they had it elsewhere first makes zero sense, but I hear it constantly. 

In computer programming, this term is known as NIH syndrome, or "not invented here." It's an argument for not using technology just because it's NOT homegrown.

Now, as a localvore--yes, my elitism has even pervaded my eating habits!--I am a HUGE fan of homegrowing pretty much everything. :)

However, like a beer opened a week ago, this idea which was once delicious can turn rancid if we take it too far. After all, was the automobile invented in San Diego? No. Why do we drive?

Were freeways invented in San Diego? No, they were invented in Germany in the 30's. Nobody has a problem with them--nor should they. If they did, they'd be miserable here indeed.

So again, after we pull the dry wall off the old building wall, we see the same old double standard rearing its ugly head like so many cockroaches.

People just hate bicycles and they feel that's not acceptable so they need to make some noise with their lips to justify their neglect of infrastructure.

I guess, I wish people would be a bit more honest.

Anyway, I think that like Queer Nation, we should dust off this old battle cry, "This Ain't Copenhagen" to answer the question, "Why are you in the street."

It's because, despite our best efforts, we have no where else to go.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>My Commute V</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[At this point, I breathe a small sigh of relief. Not of total relief, but just a small sigh. This is because there's about half a mile of straight away now with a bicycle lane.

Spots like these are the reason why I actually _like_ riding through some spots in Mission Valley. Sometimes. It's because when you are in a hurry, you can really go fast.

Am I in a hurry? Usually not, but it's nice to have some time, uninterrupted, to think.

During this time, I usually look to my left and see a nature preserve--no joke. It's fenced off and everything. Fancy.

On the other side of the four lane "road" is the Eight. Everyday, I look over there a bit wistfully wondering how safe and fast my commute would be if I could ride, from mesa to mesa, without going into the valley. 

Now there are certain advantages to me climbing up hill "both ways", but I think that you can't blame a guy for wanting his life to be more comfortable. Not as comfortable as an auto, but a bit more than having to climb every day.

At any rate, the next part of my commute is relatively flat.

Even before, I get to the turn, I start looking back, behind me, to see if there's anyone going to pass me.

This is one way of avoiding the right hook.

Most vehicles either pass me and make their turn ahead of me which is OK or they wait behind me, which is also OK.

Occasionally, there's stacking, but not so often.

Next, I make a turn onto Ward Rd where I pass the filled parking lot of 24 Hour Fitness.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Last weekend, my SO did something for me that few men experience. It was fantastic, and I now I love her even more--if that was possible.

What she did was change my front derailler.

Previously, I had ordered one from the world's best bicycle mechanic ever, Mr. T, who kindly redirected me away from the product that had come with my bicycle, and to something a bit more sturdy.

But my SO put it on.

It worked great. 

Of course, as all derailler changes, it needed slight adjustment most of which I was able to put off until I got to work.

There was the usual shanderfraude--I think, I'm not sure anymore as it doesn't bother me. 

I was asked, "Something wrong with your bike," in what I thought was a bit more hopeful of a voice than necessary.

I told him the above, and he seemed stunned. "A woman, too!"

I told him that she fixes bicycles better than I can, and he walked away shaking his head in disbelief. I think I rocked his world.

For every other person who walked past me while I adjusted my gears, I told them the same story.

My SO is brilliant, and I want the world to know!]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Outlaws

One of my favorite computer games, Nuclear War, now defunct from Sweden, had the notion of Outlaw.

For a small tax break, you would have Outlaw status which meant that the police would no longer protect you. You could be killed with impunity, but only by other Outlaws. 

In many ways, bicycles are treated as Outlaws.

I definitely like this in many way because it's highly cool to be an Outlaw.

On the other hand, bicyclists still have the police hassling us. For example, while riding behind a woman, I couldn't tell what race she was, perhaps Mexican, the police harassed her for running the same stop sign that I had run.

Great way to ingratiate oneself to a neighborhood by harassing a minority and a female. Tough guy.

It's not that I wanted to be harassed, but he just threatened her with a ticket and then drove away. I would rather just get a ticket rather than be yelled at because it seems so arbitrary and pointless. Plus, if we don't get protection, why do we get bothered?

What does it mean that we don't get protection?

Recently, a motorist in LA was jailed for trying to kill cyclists as any failed murdered should be.

However, in some cases, even of assault, the police didn't bother to come. When given the eye witness account and information to follow up this crime, they did nothing.

So it seems they give more weight to one cyclist who runs a stop sign than to a potential homicidal truck driver.

Again, I can see us being Outlaws, but this must be consistent.

I'm not going to suggest that cyclists should commit crimes of any kind. We should not.

However, I think we should start giving a proportional response to crimes.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Parking Removal</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/04/06/parking-removal/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The other day, I got a message that should have been titled: "Bike Lane Implementation" or "Sane Streets Are Here" or "Cyclists, San Diego Kinda Sorta Loves You Sometimes" or "Copenhagen is Here!" 

Something positive, right?

Instead it reads: "PARKING SPACE REMOVAL NOTICE" in huge letters as if it's the apocolypse or something.

Subtitle is "Limited Areas on Ruffin Road..." Blah. Blah. Blah.

It goes on to say "Bicycle Lane Improvement Project". I should be thinking, "well finally." But instead, I think.

They did it again. 

The motorists managed to blame another one of their problems caused by too many people going to the same place which is limited by the laws of physics, the sizes of vehicles, and motorist's own limited desire to walk any more than they need to, and they blame the whole thing in cyclists.

Basically, if you have any structure, you are limited by a circle around it for the amount of parking there is. You can do a few things to make it bigger. Make the spots smaller which is bad because it eliminates "freedom". You could make the circle bigger, but people don't want to walk. So what do you do?

Most of us would say that this is a problem that has no solution unless they do what I'd like and create, instead of a circle, but a parking lot _sphere_ around the building. Now the distance is the same, but people are going up and down to get to the building. I'm talking basement and roof top parking if we are going to do with without the coolness of anti-gravity and hovercars.

Oh, one other limitation that I forgot to mention is real estate costs. They are very high in Southern California, and yet parking should be free. How to reconcile this?

The usual method is to off load the whole thing to the "public" which means that we all pay the same at the restaurant tab no matter how much we eat.

If you have 10 cars, and parking if free then you get 10 spots for free. If you own no cars, well, you pay for the other person's ten spots.

Do I have a problem with paying for parking for people whom I don't know some of whom are taking up way more than their fair share?

No. Usually, I have no problem with any form of welfare or social program even if it helps motorists who are wealthier than me. I have no interest in checking up on the "entitlement" of free parking for freeloaders at all.

However, I think it would be nice to have bicycle lanes.

If this means creating them in the most sane place possible with minimal resource usage, I think that this is a rational decision.

Also, parking is, by law, in San Diego REQUIRED for all building occupants. 

That means that if you build a high rise with 3000 units, you need to build at least 3000 parking spaces. I think I covered this before, but this is one of the many reasons why things are so huge here, so spaced out, and why walking is a bit more boring that it needs to be.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>VC Snopes</title>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So when I said I was going to drop the whole "arguing with VC people" and the whole Quisling thing, I lied!

Arguing is too much fun, and my princess likes it, too.

Heres's a quote from the latest missive by Silas responding to this story:

http://www.care2.com/causes/mom-could-be-jailed-for-letting-child-bike-to-school.html

"Besides, the logic is flawlessly simple: The notion that separation is necessary for safety implies that cycling without separation is unsafe."

Finally, we get beyond the name calling! 

This is a common misconception in the VC community.

Actually, as I had told Silas many a time, regular cycling commuters without cars, who want infrastructure, know the facts. Many of them are league certified instructors.

Therefore, all this is compelling, it's false.


"In my incident and in this story from Tennessee, the cycling that was deemed dangerous by the respective officers was cycling without separation."

I'm not going to rehash the facts here, but though it's commonly believed that cycling on the street is dangerous, it's not. VC knows and and we know it.

So this is pointless to get caught up in other people's lack of information.

"That's the connection."

Because we thought it was dream logic before. 

No sarcasm here. I really did.

"The biggest challenge to cycling advocates is convincing others that cycling without separation -- on roadways "mixing it up" with cars --is a safe and reasonable activity."

They have been trying to do this for thirty years.

Part of the problem is that sometimes riding on the streets _is_ dangerous. It depends very much on the street. It also depends upon the rider skill and the motorist's familiarity with cyclists. Also, it's dangerous for _motorists_ on certain streets because they are badly designed.

So he's trying to convince people of something that's only sometimes true which won't benefit them--as motorists--at all. I wonder why he's failing so badly. :)

"Succeeding in accomplishing that will get the police and irate motorists from harassing us, as well as encourage more people to take up cycling."

Actually, it won't.

Assholes will be assholes. Educate an asshole and you get an asshole. Hell, motorists know that other CARS can drive on the road, but did Silas ever hear of road rage?

"Clamoring for separation undermines such efforts because it implicitly presumes the exact opposite position... that separation is required for safety."

I don't think that this is true. I think we can have both. I don't see why not.

Also, more people will NOT cycle because it's too loud and annoying to ride a bike. Plus the hills are too hard. 

Separated facilities will solve these problems. Whether that gets more people to ride, I don't know. I don't have a crystal ball. I think it will.

However, it will make things easier for ME. Silas on the other hand admitted to not riding to places because it's too hard.

When I mentioned that facilities can help such as easier grades like the ones that are all ready available to him in his car, he went silent.

Which is why I'm writing here and not wasting time arguing with him. 

Because he has a fundamental inability to listen.

"After all, if separation is not required for safety, how is it justified?"

This is funny because I told him over and over again that the reason I want separated facilities is COMFORT.

Just like we have pads on our seats instead of sitting on metal pipes, I'd like a bit of comfort on my daily ride home.

I also said that a bike path is like a piece of pizza. I want one even if it's bad for me because it tastes good. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[As a software developer who works in Serra Mesa and lives in City
Heights, I ride to and from work, daily on Fairmount Ave.

While it is a fast paced street, it does offer and ample shoulder to
bicycle on. Furthermore, it is the quickest and easiest route from
home to work and back.

However, recently, construction workers used the lane to place cones and signs.

While I appreciate that road users need to be notified of
construction, and that workers need to protect themselves, I wish that
the workers would give cyclists the same protection and courtesy that
they expect from motorists.

This will require for them to move the cones out a few feet into the
lanes that they currently occupy.

This should not be any more expensive, difficult, nor will it impair
traffic anymore than existing construction. Yet, having a comfortable
place to ride makes the difference in my commute home--and it could be
difference between life and death for a cyclist.

Thus, I ask you to please instruct the workers to give us the few feet
that we need in order to ride up Fairmount comfortably.

Advocates are pro-active.

What does this mean?

This means that advocates actually _do_ things. 

They have a given track record of accomplishments that measurable.

For example, for the cycling world, this means traveling to other 

This means going out to find new innovations to bring them here.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[cabo todo list

1. instead of asserting that it "represents the community", conduct a survey and start working on the top three items as given to the community

2. Urge to fast track NACTO or its equivalent instead of dithering around. Sine NACTO was written by traffic engineers and lawyers, all objections should be in the form of published scientific papers or legal briefs both written by trained professionals, only.

3. push for the re-introduction of the 3 foot passing law and don't delay its passing

4. create a task force which will immediately go to Amsterdam and to find cultural changes, infrastructural improvements, and educational improvements that can be enact each year for the next five years until our ridership and safety exceed those two cities.

5. look at the plan by Castro got to 96% literacy in a single year:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Literacy_Campaign

using his model or something better aim for a 96% educated motorists and cyclists about the "rights to the road".

6. Redefine "rights to the road" as 51% ridership on cycling for commuting as well as zero deaths for cyclists in the state of California. Until this happens, we must continue to push for "rights to the road".

7. Update all education by lawyers and licensed traffic engineers, the education guides. Then get the guides recognized under state law as part of the highway manual. Make it illegal for cycling courses to be taught which are not in accordance with state law.

8. Hire a part time lawyer as a consultant to sign off on all legal issues. Do the same with a traffic engineer for engineering issues. Do not make any statements with regard to these areas without first professional consultation.

9. Publish the meeting location in advance. 

10. Set term limits for the board.

  <title>More on Vehicular Mitigation</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/?p=1159</link>
  <pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov -0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The whole idea of mitigation has been rattling around in my head for a while like a loose bicycle wheel.

One of my biggest influences has been a little friend of princesses who had some brilliant ideas on making traffic lights more friendly for the handicapped and elderly. If a child can innovate so well, there's no excuse for the rest of us.

Also, I have been trying to figure out what I'd like to see if all the current challenges are out of my way, and I can have anything, traffic-wise, that I want. What do I really want.

This got me back to mitigation, thoughts.

First let's get things straight and figure out what I mean by mitigation:

http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Mitigation+of+Damages

Basically, I mean it similarly to the legal sense, though, of course, it's perfectly legal, and even encouraged by our government to cause problems with one's automobile and NOT have to mitigate it at all.

So, as I am not a lawyer, I'm not speaking in the legal sense, but rather in a more general sense, a "blog" sense, if you will.

One might think that I'm being a bit silly here, but here's some food for thought.

More Americans die each YEAR in the US due to automobiles than were killed EVER by the death penalty.

I'm starting counting in the 1600's!

From our good friend wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_the_United_States

"The Espy file,[13] compiled by M. Watt Espy and John Ortiz Smykla, lists 15,269 people executed in the United States and its predecessor colonies between 1608 and 1991. 4,661 executions occurred in the U.S. in the period from 1930 to 2002 with about two-thirds of the executions occurring in the first 20 years.[14] Additionally, the United States Army executed 135 soldiers between 1916 and 1999.[15][16][17]"

If that doesn't boggle one's mind, you can stop reading now because I'm just not reaching you.

Thus, I do think that the onus should be 100% on the motorist to mitigate the harm that they do.

Thus, there should be ZERO emissions of fumes which are known to cause asthma in children. Zero tolerance at its best.

Also, all cars should be in bright colors. 

I almost get hit, all the time by cars because I can't see them. Their lights should be on at all times, also.

Instead of these crazy and deadly looking front grills there should be cotton candy or some other kind of mattress of pillow so that if they hit someone, they won't do as much harm.

All motorists should be required by law to have helmets on at all times.

Not because helmets will help, but because the act of putting a helmet on tells someone they are putting themselves at grave risk which is one of the main reasons why I am against cyclists helmets. The other one is that it's not on me to protect myself from getting hit by a car, and that helmets don't help anyway.

Automotive helmets would prevent or mitigate the 250,000 that motorists get while INSIDE THEIR CARS. (Sorry to shout here, but people seem to think that the only danger is outside the car and that inside they are 100% safe. This is false).

Anyway, these are but a few of the brilliant ideas we'll see to come. I'm sure if I let a little child work on this, she'd come up with something far better. ]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[http://news.discovery.com/human/humans-not-nasty-behavior-120220.html<br /><br />"De Waal showed the audience videos from laboratories revealing the dramatic emotional distress of a monkey denied a treat that another monkey received; and of a rat giving up chocolate in order to help another rat escape from a trap."<br /><br />Which raises the question, why are motorists so mean?<br /><br />Why do they view it as a hardship to give up a tiny bit of space to save some human lives? Why do so many motorists harass women? When was the last time did someone say, as a human, God damnit, I will not tolerate this abuse from my group, motorists?<br /><br />We just let the anger and hate fester. Why?<br /><br />Why are so many cycling advocates nasty?<br /><br />I have the answer!<br /><br />Or rather an answer.<br /><br />To me, it's like a 1970's sci-fi horror flick where humans are captured by aliens and forced to fight one another for their own amusement.<br /><br />If they do not select a weapon, an automobile, they will be immediately killed. If they do select a weapon, they will be forced to kill, and yet they still risk being killed, too.<br /><br />This is how are roads are designed.<br /><br />And yet when people talk about motoring, they talk about how annoying cyclists, humans who choose to be unarmed, are. They also whine about how to store their lethal weapons aka parking.<br /><br />That's it!<br /><br />The are totally and completely submissive to the aliens who laugh at our every move! "Well that's how things are, what do you expect?"<br /><br />I expect to be harassed and tortured by humans, who are by their nature kind, but now they are forced to act in an inhuman manner.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Traffic Jam == Double Plus Good Cycling</title>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Today, on the highway (not freeway for East Coasters) that I ride my bike on, there was a traffic jam.

What does that mean for me? Smoother, safer, easier, more quiet, and pleasant cycling.

In the past, the city has been asked to traffic calm this street as it is the only way for cyclists to get through to this part of Mission Valley. For motorists, there is a quicker, more convenient, more expensive, better maintained freeway.

No, said the city, we can't for a whole host of reasons.

None of these reasons turned out to be true.

Whatever economic or legal fallout they foresaw did not happen.

If driving slower were illegal, why were not all the cars ticketed for this? Did the  city broke the law?

Alternatively, if this _is_ the law, then the law has no basis in reality because things were fine.

While I try to be a cycling Pollyanna, it's very distressing to see that when there are tiny, tiny cracks in the system, cycling becomes awesome. This was the same result with the power outage.

This is what makes me realize that the city is actively working to make cycling suck in San Diego.

So my new #1 priority is not for the city to spend a dime on making cycling better. Just stop spending tax money to make cycling suck. It's as simple as that.

If it means turning off the traffic lights, so be it. If we are really so poor that we can't spend cycle track pennies on the freeway dollars, we are too poor to make cycling suck.

Yet another experiment where things turned out to be the opposite of how they told us it would be.

Thanks for making cycling suck, assholes.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Montezuma Solved</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/?p=1334</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So here's what I have as a short term solution to the deaths on shroads like Montezuma.

Park a police car in the middle of a travel lane at each choke point.

I first learned about this idea when, last week, a normal car was parked in the bike lane right before the dangerous merge from Fairmount to Aldine Drive.

Nobody harassed the motorist for totally "taking the lane" and blocking traffic, making people slow down to get around, etc, even though he was taking up more room than two cyclists riding abreast. The hypocrisy in some motorists is astounding and ought to be routinely mocked. :)

Anyhow, the parked car was getting lots of space in passing, at least two feet which is more that I get unless I swing my bike lock at the cars which suddenly improves the motorist's vision and manners by several fold.

The best part is that when I passed the car, in the door zone, the motorists gave ME at least two feet. 

Then I realized, who determines what happens in the city? The police.

I mean, they can park where ever and when ever they want. There were four of them parked on the sidewalk last Friday despite the fact that there were no more serious crimes than skateboarding and teenage pregnancy going on nearby. :)

Since they can park anywhere, why not at choke points? They could block the lane, make people go around and provide protection in the form of an entire police car. Who'll fuck with that?

You don't need a working police car, take one that was going to the dump and put it in the travel lane on Montezuma in key places. This is practically free was we were going to scrap the car anyway.

The best part is that this can be done right now.

It's totally legal. Police block traffic all the time and the world is still the same; we are not collapsing anywhere. Plus, it will actually save time because it will stop future accidents which waste more time than it takes to slow down to get around a police car.

People magically are much, much nicer to me when the police are around. Thus this will also reduce crime.

The only thing that bothers me is that I have to be the one to think of all these totally inexpensive and obvious solutions.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Passive Rejection</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[There seems to be a personal taboo in saying the simple, honest truth: some people only like bicycles when they are used impractically.

That is, some people are OK with biking on the boardwalk or a isolated path, but not to get to work or to the grocery store.

This leads to a series of phrases that seem to be reasonable, but actually, to the trained ear, sound like utter stupidity.

Those of us who are naive end up addressing the phrase instead of realizing that they disguise a disgust for the use of cycling to work to save money, for fun, or out of principle. 

I probably mentioned before that feelings of disgust are the basis of human morality.

Thus, they actually think that practical cycling is immoral, but won't even admit it to themselves because it sounds stupid. 

The reason it sounds stupid is because it is.

Here are some of the phrases:

1. Things are too far to cycle to. Then you mention infilling, and their noses crinkle at the notion of being "urban". Yuck. It would suck to be urban like NYC, our center of fashion, art, culture, and finance.

2. Cycling is "impractical". (See 1).

3. Cycling is too dangerous. Then you mention infrastructure and we say:

4. Infrastructure is too expensive.

5. There's no room for infrastructure.

6. Infrastructure unnecessary.

7. The streets are for cars.

The point is that arguing with any of these phrases is pointless because many people have a deep seated belief that cycling is "dirty". No joke.

Addressing the content of any of these ideas is a total waste of time.

I do believe that exposing these false beliefs to the light is step one. The reason I call the beliefs as false is that most people who hold them will think that they are silly when they are put into words which is why they must disguise their idiotic ideas with bland, meaningless, and sensible sounding phrases.

"Walking down (the center of the travel lane) of the road I only know". :)

Recently, I had the audacity to post the original Cross study, again, on a forum:

http://isocrates.us/bike/2012/04/yer-morning-chuckle/

I love this because 99% of the assholes who lecture people on VC as if it's God's Own Word, believe that Forester has based his beliefs on solid research. What fools!

My goal is becoming a reality and that fills me with joy. 

Here are my twin anti-VC goals

1. Get VCers away from Ken Cross. This is happening below.

2. Force VCers off the issue of safety. This is the trump card that they have. We are taking that away. Once this is gone, the mask will be off, and it will show that regardless of safety VCers want to ride as fast as they can without anything in their way. This, too, is happening.

I had all ready addressed this:

http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/01/19/burning-kens-on-my-lawn/

Me:

"In Effective Cycling, Forrester talks about a study which “proved everything he had been saying.”

Please read it before any other discussion on EC:

http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=ken%20cross%20study%20pdf&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCMQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fntl.bts.gov%2Flib%2F25000%2F25400%2F25439%2FDOT-HS-803-315.pdf&amp;ei=5TKcT427GMqO2wWM7oX3Dg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFKIZfIKX2Jhz5MwKSpKMRXBm8tPA&amp;cad=rja

I argue that in fact Mr. Cross’ study contradicts nearly everything that Forrester has ever said and that EC is a vast excercize in Confirmation Bias (read about this on wikipedia)."

Here are the first stupid responses:

"Which particular points does the Cross study contradict in John Forester’s work? I’ve not looked at the Cross study recently, but I don’t recall any specifics in it that outright prove all of Forester’s points to be wrong, and I’ve read a bunch of studies that tend to support Forester’s assertions – for example: the 1987 Berlin Police crash study; the Aultman-Hall studies of 1998-1999; Franklin’s 1999 review; Wachtel’s 2001 study; Reid’s 2001 paper; Jensen’s 2001 study; Agerholm’s 2008 study; Daniels’ 2009 study and Reid’s 2011 study.

My point is this: I think the available studies tend to support Forester (even if Cross can be shown to disagree with him). As for my criticisms of Forester, the fact that I think he’s an asshat doesn’t mean I think he’s wrong. The problem we’re discussing here is that his rightness tends to be dismissed out of hand by many who are angered by the fact that he’s an asshat."

Note, that he cherry picked studies?

It's our old friend, Confirmation Bias, a biased search for information:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias#Biased_search_for_information

"Fred, I’m reading through the link you posted. I don’t see anywhere that the Cross study clearly conflicts with Forester’s conclusions. I do notice that Cross has made some perhaps naive conclusions in regard to some accident types and reports that were used in the study. But for a study done 35 years ago, it’s not too bad. I wish the link showed more of the collision types – it seems to show only a small sample.
Posted 28 Apr 2012 at 1:46 pm "

Me:

"Oh, it really makes me angry when people say that Forester’s rightness is because he’s not a nice person.

I started out as a fan. Don’t put words into my mouth (or anything else).:)

This is a total insult to my intelligence. I have done tons of research on this. It’s my research AND ALL OF PREDICTIONS TOTALLY FAILING AND the fact that the vast majority of traffic experts reject his findings is what makes me reject his ideas.

Let’s not get personal here.

He’s totally wrong.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias#Biased_search_for_information

When cycle tracks were built, we got LESS accidents not MORE even without helmets.

The jury is in: VC is dangerous, infrastructure saves lives and gets people cycling.

Oh, when I read most other “pro-VC” papers, they, too, show the opposite."

Yes, the Cross study sucks! This is precisely where I wanted ppl to go to.

I am going to continue to press people back to several fall back positions.

Let’s save lots of time and skip all the steps and move to 8. You lose.

First we have:

1. VC is great because it is backed by research (Cross)

2. Actually Cross’ research sucks, but VC is still true for more bizarre reasons.

3. A series of non-sequitors.

4. Calling me names, asking for my title and credentials

5. Cooking up some modern BS videos and slide shows to show that VC is true.

6. More VC BS

7. Deciding that safety is actually impossible. Yet another fall back position.

8. Calling me a troll and not responding to me anymore. At this point, I have shut down more VC nonsense as they fail to respond to logic and reason. I win.

If the Cross study is wrong then VC is wrong. This is Forester’s position. Please read the WHOLE study.

I know that this is a total waste of time, but for me, it's more fun than arranging; I love to totally dominate the discussion online regarding VC cycling.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Balboa Park Plan 2013</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This post isn't strictly about bicycles, but it is related.

Long time readers know that I despise Balboa's Park because it's not suitable for bicycle riding. Unlike a few other parks where I can think of where you can ride for miles without encountering a single motor car, in Balboa Park, cars are a constant irritant both with the noise level as well as the danger they pose.

I'm actually more on edge while cycling inside the park than outside perhaps because I expect the opposite? I mean what kind of "park" sucks to bike through.

Balboa is the answer.

Anyway, I haven't come here to whine about Caesar but rather to fix her.

Here goes:

Most traffic demand in the park is driven by the expectation of free parking.

Related to this I have started reading _The High Cost of Free Parking_ which so far is utterly brilliant.

Also, there are two atrocious plans which are there to "fix" the problem mainly by building more roads and more parking. Yeah! There's a brilliant idea.

Both plans are bad, but the worst calls for PAID PARKING.

All I have to say about that is, pardon the French, but ARE THESE MORONS OUT OF THEIR FUCKING MINDS? Paid parking?

Sorry, but in San Diego, nobody pays for parking as it's always abundant and free. And if it's not, then people go else where. End of story.

What's silliest about these plans are that motorists made them. Wow, know thyself.

Anyway, I was going to make my own plan, but 5 minutes of google gave me a better plan.

Yes, that's right, FIVE MINUTES OF GOOGLE GAVE ME A BETTER PLAN THAN TWO THAT ARE BEING SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED TO "FIX" BALBOA PARK!

http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=balboa%20park%20san%20diego%20number%20employees&amp;source=web&amp;cd=14&amp;ved=0CKwBEBYwDQ&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sandiego.gov%2Fpark-and-recreation%2Fpdf%2Fparkdesign%2Fbpparkingmanagementplan.pdf&amp;ei=qpS9T6q3OKSBsgK4s7wm&amp;usg=AFQjCNHwjrGnzhlaBy75EZFfqPNB_faREw

I'll go over the actual plan in another post, but until then, enjoy the 1000 page book by Shoup as well as the 117 page report. That should keep you busy for a few hours until I get my next post up. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[These stories leave me speechless.

Here I'll just post the news with minimal commentary.

When a cyclist dies, here's the investigation:

"According to police, the drivers and many witnesses stopped and provided statements. Still, police are asking for the public's help.  
"If anyone did see what happen though or may have been here during the accident and wants to give up some information, please call the police department. We'd be glad to talk to you.," said Lt. Jerry Hara with the San Diego Police Department."

http://www.sandiego6.com/news/local/Bicyclist-Killed-by-Several-Cars-in-Clairemont-143867526.html

Got that. We'll just sit around and wait for the phone to ring with "information". Thanks.

San Diego’s lieutenant of Traffic Division Rick O’Hanlon said, “it is not the police department’s decision to file charges. Even if we make a custodial arrest, the City Attorney has within their latitude to dismiss the charges.”

http://www.gjel.com/blog/san-diego-police-say-in-cyclist-vehicle-accidents-stiffest-charges-are-traffic-violations.html

When an office dies:

"Today is a difficult day for all people who serve in San Diego's finest," said the chief, who called the shooting an "assassination."

http://www.kpbs.org/news/2011/aug/07/san-diego-police-shot-critically-hurt-suspect-dead/

Got that? A cyclist's death is a traffic incident where they aren't even sure whether they are able to file charges, but a police officer's death is an "assasination."

It gets better. Next, the police sat around by their phone waiting for someone to call right?

Haha.

"At about 6 p.m., police found the Audi outside some apartments in the 4000 block of 48th Street. Collins said a police helicopter directed ground units to the 48th Street address as the suspect with the shotgun got back into the Audi. 
Police blocked the street in an attempt to stop the car, but the suspect allegedly grabbed the shotgun and was fired upon by multiple officers."

Well, while they do nothing, that can be a form of malignant neglect, but they aren't running people over, are they?

"Nationally, 123 people died in 2009 from crashes involving a police vehicle, but only 33 deaths happened when blue lights and sirens were on for an emergency response, federal figures show."

"Georgia counted 2,422 crashes involving police vehicles in 2011, and police were likely at fault in nearly 1,400, numbers from the Georgia Department of Transportation show. Of those crashes, 533 resulted in injury and more than half were likely caused by the police vehicle."
But at least they're sorry, right?

"In fatality crashes for the year, two of the three deaths were likely the fault of the civilian vehicle involved, GDOT indicated...police say officers are often the ones hurt by drivers who aren't paying attention to the road or don't hear the sirens blaring."

Get it? If you get hit by a speeding officer, it's your fault for not getting out of the way.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Honesty in Advocacy</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/?p=1551</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This is going to be a more of an overview of my feelings on advocacy rather than advocacy itself.

To be fair, let's not that I'm NOT an advocate because I don't DO anything in the real world.

On the other hand, I am a sideline cheerleader, idea person, statistics analyzer, fact checker, and comedian.

I struggle to be as honest as possible. When speaking about safety of modes, I was told that I shouldn't speak of the dangers of cycling because that doesn't promote cycling. 

Well guess what, I really do think that honesty is best.

However, I am noticing a lack of dishonesty in many cases with cycling advocacy.

I have beaten the VC issue to death, but it bears mention here that they are really concerned with racers and speed rather than absolute safety.

Then there's the helmet debate with intelligent (mainly) cyclists getting in bed with cyclists haters in order to convince us that we'll all be "organ donors" unless we ride with a plastic colander on our heads at all times. Yes, the cyclists want to prevent the massive head injuries from getting hit by cars, oops I'm sorry, I meant minor scrapes on the noggin from solo falls. They are honest. But the anti-cyclists are totally dishonest.

There's much more. You usually find dishonesty cloaked in the form of righteousness such as calling cyclists arrogant as if this were a sin. There's also the cloak of vague and academic language which tries to win the debate by mystification. 

Sorry, if you can't tell it to a nine year old, I'm not going to parse it.

There's also the cloak of making up our own language. Again, I will read the words to mean how I know they are. If I need a glossary, I am not interested.

What I want most of all from all of us, cyclists and non-cyclists is to really, really honest with ourselves.

Do cyclists really cause that much harm or do we just hate cyclists and want them harassed by cops?

Are helmets really that helpful or harmful?

Are bike paths really a deadly disease?

If sidewalk and alley riding so deadly why to parents, even VCers, train their kids there instead of the "safe" travel lane on a shroad?

Do we really give a shit about safety or do we really just want to ride fast?

I don't wish to hear the answers, I just want people to be honest with themselves first. You can later on go out there and lie to all of us. 

But please don't bullshit yourself; there's no reason for it.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Incompetents Should Not Drive the Discussion</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/?p=1897</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[It seems that since we think that everyone's opinion is equal, we should listen to everyone about every topic not matter how incompetent the person professes to be. 

In fact, it seems that not only are people incompetent, but they are proud of this incompetence and they brag about it.

For example, when we talk about putting in bicycle lanes, we hear stuff like "nobody rides their bicycle on this street."

This is clearly wrong, but the deeper issue is that when we hear things like this, it's a red flag that the person is totally incompetent when it comes to judging the need for infrastructure. This incompetence is compounded when we learn that they are also not regular bicycle riders. Some of them think that one can not possibly ride a bicycle to work and that my morning commute which I ride daily to feed my family is a worthless hobby. Well, after this, why don't we educate these people or at least shut them out of the discussion until they educate themselves? This is not an equal opinion we are talking about but a total lack of touch with reality.

Things get better when we hear people say, "I can't possibly live my life without a car." 

OK, great, you're a big man to admit your personal weaknesses and limitations, but this should be last thing we listen to regarding cycling from this person. These people like to go on and on about how dangerous cyclists are, but how do they know that when they admit that they can't even imagine riding their bicycle to work. This is strange because I can imagine myself jumping over the moon and eating it's delicious green cheese. While I know that these things are impossible, at least I can _imagine_ it. With limited imagination come solutions which only look like the past.

And if the past design is so great, why are we talking about it as if there is a problem now? So clearly things were done badly in the past, and we need to imagine a better future.

Let's not sacrifice a bold vision on the altar of the incompetent!

  <title>Lack of Active Transportation Dooms Millions to Pain</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/?p=1913</link>
  <pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov -0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[http://www.alternet.org/food/guess-whos-behind-new-findings-its-healthy-be-overweight?paging=off

I really loved this story especially this bit:

”While some people who lose weight do keep it off, she says they are as rare as people who win the lottery. “OK, they exist,” she says, “But if I'm a health care provider, if I know that 98% of the people I send down this road will end up sicker, physically and psychologically, why would I do that?”

Yes, but we should take into account our built environment which kind of sucks for building exercise into one's life. 

This is probably said too many times here, but you can't really hold people accountable for their exercise when they can't do it safely. This is why I think that we should have more cycling infrastructure, as a public health concern.

More important than worrying about whether the right BMI for women is 27.3 or 25, the more important thing is for them to get some fitness into their lives.

Also, as I stated before, I do not think that making and selling junk food should be legal. It serves no purpose other than to make many, many people fat and a few of them rich. Hurting the public is a dubious freedom at best: the freedom to eat absolute trash which only leaves you broke, hungry, and fat is one in which I could do without.

This excellent podcast elaborates on these notions: 

http://c-realm.com/podcasts/03-michael-goodwin-how-did-the-richest-country-in-the-world-come-to-eat-such-cruddy-food/

What about the freedom to build exercise into your commute? Is this not more important?

For me this is a big shift in thinking, too: the whole notion of fitness vs. athletics.

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/03/education/spelman-college-withdrawing-from-ncaa.html?_r=0

“When we studied this early this year, I was startled to see that we really had only 80 student athletes out of 2,100 students, and our program was costing almost $1 million,” said Beverly Daniel Tatum, the college president. “I was also surprised to learn of studies showing that African-American women are the least physically active demographic in the U.S.”

For me, this is a really tough topic because for the longest time I had felt that I didn't like to exercise and I definitely did not value fitness. I realize that while I still eschew cycling racing, I do feel a great deal of gratitude for my good fortune to have excise as part of my commute.

However, I do feel that my fortune is due to luck, and if I were from San Diego, I would probably not be a cycling commuter.

I think that we should follow the bold lead of Spelman and to indulge ourselves in the luxury of active transportation. After all, this would cost much less than the luxury we all ready have of being fat and unhealthy.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I probably said this before, but I'll say it again, I can't stand selfish people who whine about their "gas money" and "tax money" because the ones that whine the most are those who benefit the most from the others.

Thus, I, too, would like everything to be perfectly fair which would mean that I owe a lot of people around the world some time in sewing and fruit picking.

The tax foundation posted a study which shows what share of roads are built with the so called "gas money" aka all motoring user fees.

http://taxfoundation.org/blog/road-spending-state-funded-user-taxes-and-fees-including-federal-gas-tax-revenues

California ranks at 34.4% which means that we spend three times too much for roads.

A good start for tax paying advocacy would be to demand that we cut our road budget in half.

We MUST do this if we are consistent and want to be 100% fair as can be.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Are Misleading Helmet Statements Illegal? </title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[LTRs can skip this one.

One thing I hadn't thought of regarding the "helmets prevent 85% of injuries" claim for helmets is that this might actually be illegal.

http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/policystmt/ad-decept.htm

"Most deception involves written or oral misrepresentations, or omissions of material information...The issue is whether the act or practice is likely to mislead, rather than whether it causes actual deceptions."

Here's the claim: " In regression analyses to control for age, sex, income, education, cycling experience, and the severity of the accident, we found that riders with helmets had an 85 percent reduction in their risk of head injury (odds ratio, 0.15; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.07 to 0.29) and an 88 percent reduction in their risk of brain injury (odds ratio, 0.12; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.04 to 0.40)."

http://www.cyclehelmets.org/1068.html

Why is this misleading.

First of all, I'd like to quote the usual response to criticism of this paper, that I misunderstand odd ratios. This is true.

http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CEIQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sph.unc.edu%2Fimages%2Fstories%2Facademic_programs%2Fepid%2Fdocuments%2FQualifying_Exams%2FInjury%2FReadings%2Fcummings_2006.pdf&amp;ei=kowmUajWO-XfigK0t4GQBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNGB-2Xi4VGngFKALUbpnmTskkootw&amp;sig2=s5v3TfFZ9eyPLzTi1QWW_Q&amp;bvm=bv.42768644,d.cGE

I do not understand any of the stats at all.

I don't think I need to. The claim is clear. If 100% of the people wore helmets, then head injuries would be 85% less than if 0% of people wore helmets.

http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CE4QFjAD&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.infrastructure.gov.au%2Froads%2Fsafety%2Fpublications%2F2006%2Fpdf%2Fdeath_cyclists_road.pdf&amp;ei=t5EmUbfPLoeCiwKbjYFQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHm_FcC7FBK5xw88m3szn-0pzdeuQ&amp;sig2=v6K-3eAgNtr0t-1HDA2snA&amp;bvm=bv.42768644,d.cGE

Given this data, on page 5, it's easy to see that over 50% of cyclists who got hit by cars and died were hit at 50 Km or higher. The question is that, given the high number of fatalities and injury which occured by getting hit by a high speed car, which percentage of these people would have been saved if they were wearing helmets?

  <title>Another Motorists Chimes In: Sharing the Road Sucks</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This is another repeat. Anther link bait story where I at first agree with then get pissed off as she blames me for all her problems. I have a tissue for my new friend, Melissa.

http://www.thegavoice.com/opinion/thats-what-she-said/5860-melissa-carter-cars-arent-the-problem-with-share-the-road

Cyclists often have a knee jerk reaction to the whole anti-share the road notion, but whole heartedly agree.

Like the child who cried that the Emperor had not clothing, Melissa Carter reveals the lameness that is the stupid, and failed "share the road" nonsense.

"I will honestly say that I do not believe in sharing the road. The weight of a car can be 4,000 pounds and a car can reach speeds well over 100 mph. In contrast, the average bicycle weighs about 30 pounds and an average rider can only go about 20 mph."

This is the voice of reason and is why we need our own space.

"But somehow we have decided that the way to coexist is to travel the same roads together in harmony."

If she only knew that there were a few morons out there who want this and that the vast majority of cyclists and motorists want our own space! (http://iamtraffic.org)

"However, the burden of traveling safely together ultimately depends on the driver slowing down, swerving over, etc., in an effort not to mortally wound this soul who is inching up a hill on Roswell Road during rush hour."

Yes, that's totally unfair. But it's also nice to see that this motorist realizes that it's luck in getting "good" drivers who let the VC DBs live and not some kind of superior skill.

"Often, I see a bicyclist merge into existing traffic and block a lane while holding his or her hand out impatiently for us to slow down as if we “car people” are the problem."

Ug, this sucks. I do it, but I have to in order to get to work. Still, like Melissa, I agree that this is non-optimal.

"And if you come up on a pack of riders, it is even worse since they have no problem riding side by side and taking up an entire lane."

Yes, I agree. I often actually ride in the parallel parking lane or pull over to let motorists go ahead. It's not because I feel inferior but because I have manners.

"Apparently, a jersey that has a logo or two on it along with the aerodynamic Tour de France helmet translates to some extra level of ownership of the asphalt. Sometimes they seem to be tempting someone to hit them."

I couldn't have said it better myself.

"It does not look like Atlanta will ever create enough bike paths to get cyclists off the main roads."

I disagree. I have no idea where she got this idea from. Why not push for more paths and be part of the solution to the problem that she is pointing out. Seems like she doesn't really want to solve the problem at this point. I can't prove it, but I think that this is because she doesn't want more bike paths. I hope I am wrong.

"But I do believe there is a solution that would at least make me feel like drivers and cyclists were being treated a little more fairly. 

I want everyone who wants to put their bikes on the main road to get a license and a tag."

As I wrote earlier, she moved from having a legitimate complaint and she pin pointed the solution then she ignored the solution and moved to bullying tactics.

"To pay for the new bicycle-specific testing and the enforcement, the measure would have required a fee for the endorsement test and registration via a license plate for all bicycles in Oregon."

Why testing? What is this going to accomplish?

"By having license plates on the bikes, the hope is that this would lead to more responsible behavior and make it easier to hold riders accountable for their actions."

I assume that Melissa has a license plate, but she still managed to get off at least one veiled threat in a public article "they seem to be tempting someone to hit them." 

I hope that she does not hit someone, but it seems almost as if she feels tempted (her words).

"At least if I were behind a cyclist with a license plate, I would know that my extra ten minutes in traffic were the result of some effort on the part of the rider and not just a flippant disregard for all the other tax paying citizens on the road who are doing their best to dodge them."

First of all, I call bullshit on the ten minutes.

Second, in most states motoring does not pay for the roads either. Plus most cyclists have cars so they paid for the road all ready. We also mostly all ready do have licenses.

Finally, I don't flippantly disregard other tax paying citizens (sic) as if paying taxes makes you a citizen (it does not). I don't want to be on the road, it's because motorists were too short sighted and cheap to build meaningful infrastructure as well as lame ass VC advocacy that came up with such nonsense such as "share the road" that is the cause of your misery.

"To truly share the road, we must all share the responsibility for being in each other’s path."

This just pissed me off. 

Really, she's responsible for being in my way? I estimate that my time to work is double due to me waiting for cars. Furthermore, I have NEVER had, in a traffic jam, all the cars pull to the side to let me pass. I pull over daily when I can to let people pass.

This story is just there to inflame cyclists and motorists aka link bait. I'm guilty of taking the juicy bait. The entire post, except for her down home style, which I like, could have been written by a computer as it's the same stupid propaghanda. Cyclists cause ALL the problems on the roads. Cyclists are cheap ass moochers who are totally irresponsible and no doubt the cause of every traffic jam.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the questions that has continued to plague us is the continual pushing for helmets as personal protection equipment (PPE) despite the fact that it is ineffective for the most common causes of death which is getting hit by a high speed motorist.

I feel very strongly about helmets because I believe that the promotion of helmets is a way of blaming the victim and is thus a pattern of abuse and bully behaviors that the motoring culture is continuing to inflict on the cycling community.

Since I do not live in Maryland, I am almost happy that this law is going to be passed because it enshrines in law what many organizations have all ready been advocating for. Also, it will give some decent data, in the United States that helmets are useless.

Thus, I have asked bikemd the following:

I am a blogger and I'm collecting information for a story about the mandatory helmet law (MLH) in MD for my blog, cyclingunbound.wordpress.com a San Diego, CA based cycling blog. I found your name in a recent article which I first saw on the WashCycle, and excellent blog.

I rode my bicycle through Maryland in 2008 and I was highly impressed diverse small towns, bicycle paths, and dedicated bicycle lanes on major arterials. Thus, I can only praise your organization for its successes in these regards.

I believe that advocacy should be data driven, and I am unafraid to confront any data which makes cycling more efficient, comfortable, and safer.

In no way do I feel that these questions are meant to be insulting, but I do wrestle with ethical issues myself and I appreciate any assistance that you can give while we all look at the difficult and sometimes dark side of advocacy.

Finally, I feel that someone must push the rhetoric so far that the most extreme demands by the local cycling advocacy groups look like they aren't asking for enough. This is my role so please bear that in mind.

1. How does your organization decide which public policy that your organization represents? By public policy, I mean which laws you are in favor of, against, and so on. I also mean, by public policy, which public works projects such as cycling infrastructure that your organization supports of fights.

1. Does your organization support helmet use? If so, what means do they feel that they should compel people to wear helmets?

2. Do you support a mandatory helmet law? If not, why not (in the case that you agree with #1)?

3. The helmet issue is so controversial, with people who are rabidly in favor of them as well as rabidly against them. Also there is literature which says that helmets will save 85% of all lives, while the demographic data in places where helmets are mandatory disagree. There are also many researchers who think that helmets are useless (see the British Medical Journal, for example). Given all this controversy, how does your organization come out with a coherent policy either in favor or against #1.

4. Do you feel that a mandatory helmet law is going to hurt or help the promotion of more people cycling or is the promotion of cycling to new people something your organization is not interested in?

5. If helmets save many lives and should always be worn while cycling and if helmets will hurt cycling, is there an ethical problem with failing to enshrine into law something that everyone should all ready do as it will save lives? Many CA advocates feel that helmets have saved their lives, but they refuse to stand for a MHL because they feel that it will hurt their cause--are not cyclists lives more important than the cause?

  <title>Sick of the Bullshit Cycling</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Let me re-iterate for the billionth time that my daily commute is nice, though, I realize that it should be harrowing.

I recently talked to two co-workers who told me that the main reason that they do not ride to work is due to the lack of a decent path from the top of the mesa down into Mission Valley. Fairmount Ave is a non-starter because they recognize that it is potentially deadly and always harrowing.

A co-worker of mine, last week, was shocked that both my wife and I did not use cars due to our "modern metropolis".

What he intuitively knew, but could not say, was that the reason for this is because cycling in San Diego totally sucks due to malignant neglect as well as the hard work of Quisling advocates who kept the government out of making cycling safe, while they allowed it to trod, willy-nilly, over safety.

To paraphrase one Quisling to Sandag, "I don't care what you do to the roads".

Asshole.

Here's another cyclist who realized that cycling actually sucks:

http://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/20130309/OPINION/130309607/1042/opinion?p=2&amp;tc=pg

Note that no matter how safe he is or is not, he _feels_ like crap after cycling and that's what matters to most people. He isn't going to look up some stats to see how his day was.

After reading that, for cyclists, the death rate for commonly thought dangerous activities is 10% or less, I realized that stupid organizations like the NHTSA offer suggestions that are not only condescending, but even if followed to the letter would provide marginal safety at best.

"Over time, with riders being mowed down almost monthly, I became more vigilant. I always wore bright colors, used hand signals and anticipated the actions of unsafe drivers."

So I have some questions to the NHTSA:

1. Given that we do all that you say, such as wearing bright colors and helmets, since the vast majority of collisions are not do to anything on your list, when are you going to take safety to the next level. That is, after you get ALL PEDESTRIANS and CYCLISTS in your yellow jackets and plastic hats, and we are still dying, what's the next step?

2. The same can be said for motorists as well. If we get all the drunks and texters off the road, we STILL, STILL find that the majority of killer motorists did not violate any rules at all. If this is so, what's the next move for making the roads safer?

Or are we going to just all have to get into tanks and drive those?

Can we please, please just pull the plug on the NHTSA?]]></content:encoded>

http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/18/us-eurozone-cyprus-stumbled-insight-idUSBRE92H0RH20130318?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=topNews&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FtopNews+%28News+%2F+US+%2F+Top+News%29

The phrase that struck a chord in my mind was the notion of "burden sharing". That is, the bankers fucked up and now they want to dip into people's personal bank accounts, money that should be stuffing mattresses, to pay off their mistakes which were caused by incompetence and greed.

I find the whole notion, of pedestrians, especially having to "equally share the burden" of looking both ways before they cross the street to be similarly offensive.

Pedestrians created zero percent of the danger and now they are being billed with fifty percent of the responsibility. 

Is this fair?

Surely this isn't a tax in money, but it is taxing to one's mental state as well as in terms of carnage which is disproportionately (again) born by pedestrians.

Motoring danger and police aiding and abetting with the get away.

Just another way we get ripped off.

The icing on the cake is when bikes and pedestrians as asked to "pay their fair share" as if put in constant mortal danger isn't enough of a price to pay.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Many days, on Ward Rd, I go totally VC and take the LEFT lane for many reasons.

1. I'm making a left turn.

2. Traffic behind me is light on the road.

3. There's a dangerous crest of a hill that blocks one's view until the last second, making this turn super dangerous. 

4. Oncoming traffic is somewhat heavy.

5. There's a door zone in the right lane.

6. I said this before, but it bears repeating. People LOVE to hug the side of the road to the point of driving in the parallel parking lane, riding on half the should of the road to the point of always wanting to put their SUV in the gutter EVEN WHEN THERE ARE TWO LANES OR MORE WHICH ARE 90% CLEAR.

Why? I don't know.

But if people are going to be buzzing me while I ride in the door zone, I feel safer in the left lane especially when I barely get passed ever. Plus I tend to ride to the left of the left lane so that if someone does wish to get close, I can just go onto or over the double yellow line. In the door zone, there's no where to do except into a door.

Sometimes, if there is heavy traffic behind me, I will ride in door zone. The other bonus of riding in right lane is that I am closer to bus stop where they often smile back at me right before I cross over 4 lanes of a high speed road.

Once I make this turn, once again, I have another respite and a sigh or relief.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Cycling for Networking</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Like all normal people, I find the whole notion of networking to be repugnant. It seems so manipulative to meet people only to use them for one's own benefit.

On the other hand, like most other people, in order to get anything done in my actual life, I do need to meet people.

I got my job through a great friend that I met at a party. Another good friend, I met through a friend through a writing group. And so on.

So meeting people is great, but tactically trying to network sucks.

The way out is to meet in groups for people with shared interests.

Group bicycle rides are an excellent way to meet people.

I have said this for so long, it's practically a cliche, but I love to see a shiny pickup truck full of dudes who are yelling at me and my friends on a group ride about why am I doing it?

One of my friends always says, "cancer".

The funny thing is that these truck dudes are definitely looking to score. They pass by a horde of beautiful women on bicycles and all they can do is shout crude stuff.

The majority of my social life in San Diego has been through cycling. I think that group rides are also a great way for beginners to learn how to navigate the city. 

For shy people, it's great because you are doing something so you are not just trapped talking to someone or worse sitting alone. People are more approachable when it's bicycle to bicycle.

I have even had a few nice chats while commuting to work or going home with someone I met while we rode the same way.]]></content:encoded>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Last weekend, I met my first Penny Farthing rider, and he made an even huger impression on me than recumbent riders.

Before I go on, I'd like to say that I only met this guy once, but I can't identify him because he wore a Nixon mask the whole time--or he was Nixon.

Also, he disguised his voice.

Finally, the whole account below is totally fictional.

Did you ever meet a twisted, looking glass version of yourself if you had stayed on the "bad" course in your life?

I did and his name is P. Farthing.

A Penny Farthing bicycle is one of the oldest bikes which has no chain,  no gears, and no brakes. It's basically a giant wheel with pedals and a seat attached.

Though illustrations of Penny Farthings make them look like sissies, this is actually the badest ass bike ever; a tank of the bicycle world.

It can do pretty much everything I want a bicycle to do and some things I won't admit to wanting.

For example, it never gets flats. It's super easy to coast. And if it runs into a car door, by accident, it rips the door off!

It sits so high off the ground that if you get cut off and step off the bicycle you wind up standing on the hood of a car.

With no brakes, stopping is a gradual foot dragging process.

The rider seemed a combination of mania, intensity, and joy that I seldom see. For the first time, I could see, perhaps, how people saw me in the bad old days.

If I were a woman, I'd be in love!

As it is, I barely suppressed a "Where can I find you!" before I left his presence.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Bicycle Show</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Last weekend, I went to a bicycle show.

I had gone last year, and I didn't really have that much fun because I didn't know anyone.

However, we were introduced to Nobillette, an amazing builder. We all saw Blinekey from North Philly so that was good times.

In fact, my SO ordered a custom bicycle!

However, this year was better.

I guess it was because I knew more people there, again mostly through my SO.

I wish I had gone to the band which had tons of Stone Beer. Plus there were tons of parties.

On Sunday, in LA, there was the cyclovia.

So overwhelming!

But I didn't do any of that.

While I was at the bicycle show, I learned a little about what the point was when I looked at some custom parts.

This is because recently, due to poor design, my front derailler broke and I had to get a new one. 

At the bicycle show, I saw people who could machine much higher quality parts.

I guess the moral is that even though I didn't get things at first, by hanging around long enough, I was able to learn something.

I'm still not that interested in the mechanics of bicycles at all.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Kopenhavn I: Arrival</title>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[With a great friend like Cecilia to greet us, arriving in Kopenhavn was a dream. Of course, she greeted us by waving a set of Danish Flags. Definitely a relief to have a great guide in a new country.

It was so easy to get around because she showed us how to take the train. Of course, we sat in the first seat which gave us a view of the city.

The entire trip, the weather was bearable even without my heavy third upper layer and long underwear--the latter, I never used. The former I used once, and I was too warm. Thus, I was able to actually wear the same clothes I had been wearing in San Diego.

Of course as soon as I got off the subway I saw what I was looking for: bicycles, bicycles, and more bicycles.

Near every door of every shop there were lines of bicycles some of which were so dense looked like stacks and piles of bikes.

Everywhere you looked there was bicycle traffic which was thicker than auto traffic which was great because it allowed people to move more efficiently down the narrow streets.

The most peculiar thing wasn't really the bicycle infrastructure, but how inexpensive and simple it looked.

The main bike path was not, as I had expected, separated from vehicular traffic by walls, but rather it was a step up from the street with a little curb and a step down from the sidewalk. Thus all three modes ran side by side. The bicycle paths were large enough for two bicycles to ride side by side with a third to squeeze by.

The bicycles were mostly rusted and crappy three speeds, but people looked very elegant on them.

Thus, the cost was much lower than expected, and the impact was huge. I was shocked to see how little it would take to make San Diego and the rest of the United States bicycle friendly. 

Also, in Kopenhavn, all races and religions were represented on their bicycles. The only thing in common besides their mode was their glamor.

Thus, all the objections based on femininity, or suits, or physical fitness, or age or any other consideration were complete twaddle.

Often cars parked half way on the bike lane and buses unloaded passengers right on the bicycle lanes.

This confusion didn't impede the bicycle traffic in any meaningful way. The oldest ladies to the youngest children--some of them as young as four riding on their own bicycles--smoothly went around any obstruction.

The drivers were incredibly well behaved waiting behind the baby blue rectangle in front of every intersection where there was a possible right hook. 

Thus the objection about right hooks was also twaddle.

There were a very few racer types with helmets and spandex who rode much faster on newer, fancier bicycles which puts to rest the whole racing based objection to infrastructure that San Diego has been infected with in the thirty year reign as unofficial "bike expert" Jonas Trees.

All in all, everyone rode bicycles. It was so normal it was almost boring.

There were more bicycles safely accommodated on single lane streets in Kopenhavn as there are for a few hours a month in San Diego during the biggest group rides like Critical Mass. Thus, this puts to the bed the whole myth that bicycles interfere with traffic.

In fact vehicular traffic was light and moved much smoother in San Diego despite the constant lights at every intersection, lack of traffic light "triggers", and the absurdly low speed of twenty miles per hour which confirmed my hypothesis that "net traffic speed" and not "top speed" are more important. "Net traffic speed" was much higher due to the almost total lack of vehicular traffic.

This created a sense of calm and order that I had been craving for such a long time.

Sweet Kopenhavn. 

And I saw this in the first half and hour while standing on the street corner...]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Kopenhavn II: Drinking in the Streets</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Kopenhavn II: Drinking in the Streets

Cecilia left us at our hotel for an hour so that we could take naps which we did.

She came back in an hour bearing a six pack which we started drinking right away. Yes public drinking is legal, though I never did see anyone else do it. And when we did it, we got very static from anyone. Nobody seemed to notice anything we did, actually for the most part.

While my sweet SO was out there looking for an ATM, I got permission then hopped on Cecilia's bicycle. Finally, I was riding a bicycle in Kopenhavn for the first time!

It was much tougher than I though as Cecilia has an old, rusty three speed. Also the bicycle lane was really narrow, much tighter than the wide Southern California streets that I was used to. But it wasn't as bad as some people say, and I could get used to it.

It was nice to have so many people passing me. 

I rode half a block then walked by bicycle on the sidewalk back to my friend. If I wanted to ride the other way I had to cross the street. Yes, bicycle salmoning was rarely seen during my brief stay, and when they did salmon, they did so on the sidewalk which I guess is two wrongs. Nobody really seemed to mind.

The streets were semi-chaotic. Cecilia said that they were a permissive society which meant no death penalty and surprisingly little crime. Her husband, Marcellus, said, "Nothing bad happens here." Thus shattering more myths on the need for crazy security to be safe.

It seemed like myth after myth was going to be shattered with no end in sight...]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Permanent Tour

I'm proud to say that I didn't sleep in my bed last night.  :)

Yah! 

Too bad, I didn't bring a toothbrush and change of underwear.

Yuck!

I'm going to delay the Kopenhavn narrative because I wanted to write about how I felt my life was like a permanent tour.

I may have said this before, but San Diego's great weather and the summer's bright nights make it tough for me to just go home and relax. For some reason, there's always stuff going on, and I want to be part of it rather than miss out.

I loved the excitement of a real city like Philly, but eventually, I realize that the main thing I can do while in the midst of the swirl of lovely humanity is to sit at a cafe and write.

Here I can not write in cafe's; I have tried. I can write at home, but I'm never there.

Before I visited Kopenhavn, I felt burned out and the best thing I liked to do was to come home and to eat dinner while sipping a homebrew and watching comedy.

Now I love going out again. I want to do everything. 

I don't know what changed, but I'm happy about it.

For some reason, I'm not worried about being tired all the time, which I am. 

I must be jet lagged because last night, I was with some friends, and while cutting lime and cilantro, I almost passed out in the kitchen. The conversation was excellent, but with all my supreme effort, I could not keep my eyes open.

I lay down on the floor and feel asleep. They tried to rouse me but failed so my good friends tossed a blanket on me.

I'm sure a lot of cool stuff happened while I slept. 

Man, did I want some of those delicious smelling fish tacos.

I only woke up the next day and rode home to drop off veggies then straight to work. I got here an hour and a half earlier than I need to.

I feel like doing more riding after work as life is now a permanent tour.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[in Denmark, the name “Fred” is not an insult, not a cartoon, and not a punchline.

 

Freds have ruled this wise nation for centuries. Pretty much half the kings were Freds.

 

The Danes were shocked and horrified at how badly Freds were treated in the US, and they told me the name was only worthy of veneration. J

  <title>Open Letter To Kaiser</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/04/26/open-letter-to-kaiser/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Kopenhavn story will wait because I have to strike when the iron is hot.

Dear Kaiser,

This morning, while cycling to work, I saw your large, purple "Healthy Lifestyles" van. 

It reminded me that as an organization, you claim to be committed to "healthy lifestyles." Because of this, I would accept that you understand "active travel".

However, I am confused why you actively discourage active travel.

I know this because I rode my bicycle to Kaiser and there were zero facilities for me. Rather the entire building was completely built around the automobile.

1. The large parking lot in the front was off-putting for those who walked. In fact, you had to negotiate travel with cars out in the middle of the parking lot to get there.

2. There was no visible bicycle parking in front of the building, while, again, there was a huge parking lot which was an invitation for the unhealthy travel.

3. My doctor told me to exercise. When I told him I rode there, he actively discouraged me from doing this because of its danger. Even when presented with the facts, he did not back down.

It's really nice that you have decided to promote healthy living, but healthy living is more than painting a few vans and sending emails.

If your organization continues to pour money into infrastructure that discourages walking and cycling, your customers aren't going to do that.

I suggest that you really don't want people to ride their bicycles nor to walk, you should save the money on painting vans, lay off the staff that emails me, and pass those savings on to me.

Kaiser is a super large and powerful organizations. It has lots of pull in government and medical authorities it can use to make a case for active travel infrastructure. It has a huge advertising budget to get the public on its side. This money will be a fraction of the costs that it spends on parking garages, heart disease, diabetes II and other diseases created by the unhealthy lifestyle that Kaiser promotes.

Since Kaiser has chosen not to make a real efforts to making their facilities more accessible for those who choose to enjoy the Southern California weather and to walk or bicycle, I can only conclude that Kaiser is not at all serious about healthy lifestyles, and that the vans and the other publicity are there for show only. 

I only wonder why so much money is wasted having people drive around in vans when the costs of health care are so high. 

I'm going to continue with my own personal "healthy lifestyle" which at nearly 40, I have no health problems and take no medications.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[After my SO got back, all three of us started to walk towards Cecilia's place.

There it was endless beauty. The buildings were monolithic, but not in the brick lump way, but more of a European style. I'm not good at describing things.

In addition to the large, lovely buildings, there were rectangular lakes which were part of the original fortifications which included a moat. I was in heaven to recall a time where it was actually a credible defense to did holes in the ground and fill then with water.

We walked through a park where we saw three graves of increasing importance: Hans Christian Andersen (writer), Søren Kierkegaard (Christian philosopher) and best of all Natasja Saad (singer).

The park was very green and quiet. I hunted for sprinklers and was laughed at. It was wonderful to have lawns that actually could sustain themselves as if they actually belonged there.

Next we went to a park which was themed on the Bermuda Triangle. We sat on a grassy knoll and drank some more while Cecilia talked about many things but most importantly we talked about cycling, psychology, and traffic systems.

A few beers later, and we staggered back to her apartment.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Of course, the defining feature of the Danish apartments are bicycle racks. There were two very long racks, but still there were more bicycles than rack space so people parked their bicycles next to the rack using only their awesome internal lock. 

I could see why I would NOT want my regular commuter to stand out in any way. If a thief is looking at a large array of similar bicycles, he's going to go for the one which totally unlocked. If he is a lock picker, he'll go for quality.

Speaking of quality, the Danes have a word for decorating their apartments which means cosy.

This is probably due to the fact that the winters are not only long, but dark for long periods of time as they are on par with Moscow.

The walls were covered with artistic family photos, cutting edge art some of which looked like street art inspired, and Americana. OK, the way I described it makes it seem incoherent, but trust me, it wasn't.

The place was like a museum or show room from a fancy apartment. There were tons of books which is almost a prerequisite for getting close to me.

We sat and relaxed for a little bit then we were out again.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Of course, only a few hours in to our trip with a few drinks in us all ready, we headed over to an outdoor pub.

While walking over there, we walked down even denser streets which had many food stands on them. Kopenhavn smelled of hotdogs! Delicious.

My SO noticed that it wasn't a sea of blondes nor even a sea of whites, rather there were differing types of people most of whom were speaking in fluent Danish which added to the surreal feel.

In one of the narrow alleys I even saw a place to meditate. How wonderful.

Finally, we go to a large square which was paved all in stones. The adjoining streets were quiet. 

It was as if, in the middle of a large square someone had set up tables and chairs. All of them were filled with Cecilia's friends.

We sat down and met everyone, who were super-friendly. Then we started drinking again. I didn't even see where the beers were coming from.

I was especially to see Hanja and her boyfriend who would soon ride motorcycles across South America.

We talked about their trip as well as their finishing their thesis on bicycles in the San Diego and Barcelona. 

Time went really fast, of course, and people slowly started to leave.

In the meantime, of course, I had to pee.

The bathroom was the best ever. 

There was a spiral maze made from metal. In the center was a trough. I love the trough! I made many trips there.

This was one of my highlights of the trip as I adore novel bathroom technology.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[One of my favorite things to do is to meet people and this day was no exception.

Of the people I met, Mikel was one of the most out going. He talked to me as we walked back to the apartment.

He was an Americano-phile of which a lot of Danes apparently are. US cyclists love them; they love us. Sounds like a happy family.

Mikel talked about the fact that few Danes were early adopters of new technology which I thought was a good thing because it showed contentment, but because Denmark is such a small market, it was tough to get products with good Danish support. 

From my own work, I know that this is true as Danish is not part of our original languages to translate the software into. Even Dutch would have been neglected except that one salesperson wants it. 

We can't neglect our bicycle loving countries!

The walk back was not too chilly as I had worn lots of layers, but like many Danes, Mikel just shivered in his fine suit.

Finally, we got back to the apartment where we were treated to a superfine home cooked meal by Cecilia's husband. 

We could taste why she keeps him around.

From then on, we talked mostly about books as we found out that Cecilia's guests from NYC were also into writing. We even barely dodged an argument about the Oxford comma which I have strong feelings about as a fellow maven would realize by going back and looking at my longer sentences. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The night, we walked home early because we were exhausted.

We watched a little Danish TV which was fun, but strange. I don't recall what we saw. The main things I recall from the whole experience was watching "Too Fast, Too Furious II" and a Danish Steve Irwin who spent most of his time smelling koala dung.

I did like the Danish, Irwin, better because he was a normal person. In contrast, his guest on the show was being an asshole as he let spiders crawl all over himself while he bragged at how dangerous they were. Idiot show off.

As usual, my SO when it comes to the sleep department. I wish I could view sleep as an "escape" or like a friend, have amazing dreams, but I don't recall my dreams, and I wake up too soon.

Outside, there were bicycles, bicycles, bicycles and I wanted to join them, but I didn't want to leave my love.

So I sat and read _The Nectar of Manjushri's Speech: A Detailed Commentary on Shantideva's Way of the Bodhisattva_ as well as _Reluctant Metropolis_.

I also meditated for a while and drank all the beer that the hotel kindly had provided.

I don't know when, but I finally collapsed into my first Danish sleep.

I'm in Denmar]]></content:encoded>

  <title>You Look Like a Dork in a Helmet</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I have zero to offer on the helmet debate. 

In fact, writing about it goes against the spirit of this blog because this is supposed to be about bliss and cycling, and not anger.

The helmet debate royally pisses me off.

You can't have a rational debate when we don't have any standards.

I think that a cost benefit analysis is a good start. Another standard would be to measure against all other aspects of our lives.

To be fair, I'll post <a href="http://www.bhsi.org/stats.htm" title="Pro-helmet stats">some</a>.

What we need to know from this:

"Ninety-one percent of bicyclists killed in 2008 reportedly weren't wearing helmets."

So there you have it. Helmets save lives, right?

Not so fast. How many cyclists were wearing a helmet who did _not_ get hit?

Another way to look at it. Imagine a helmet offering zero protection. If this were so, and 91% of cyclists did not wear helmets then we could get the same stats from above.

However, I'll say that I do think that helmets can protect a person in some cases. For example, if I fall in the shower, I'd rather be wearing a helmet. If I walk across a street and get hit by a car, I want a helmet on my head. Same thing for slipping on a wet floor at Dennies. Or if I get into another domestic dispute and my "princess" cracks me over the head with a wine bottle--damnit, you know it, I need a helmet.

That's why when you see me at the bar tonight, I'll most certainly be wearing a helmet. Not. 

Unless it's Halloween and I want a scary costume. :)

So just because something is safer doesn't mean people do it.

But let's just say that we accept the standard that if something is correlated then it makes it right. 

This is really hard to explain so to do so, I'll make up a stat so we can see thing clearer via search and replace:

"Twenty-six percent of bicyclists who lost hands in 2008 wore wrist guards."

So we should wear wrist guards, too. Right?

Not so fast, I made up that last stat. 

Below is the real one:

"Twenty-six percent of bicyclists killed in 2008 had blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) at or above 0.08 percent."

Based on our above standard, this means that NOT drinking alcohol triples your chances of getting into an accident.

To rephrase: "Seventy-four percent of bicyclists killed in 2008 were not protected by drinking alcohol ahead of time."

But that's absurd. Because we all know that drinking makes you dangerous just as we "know" that wearing helmets makes you safe. Right?

Well, how do we know that if we just took a parallel set of stats and used it in one direction: helmets are safer, and another direction, alcohol makes you crash even though, you are more likely to crash if you don't drink.

The reason is simple.

It's called Common Sense.

Wrong.

It's actually called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question" title="Begging the Question">Begging the Question</a>

"Begging the question (or petitio principii, "assuming the initial point") is a type of logical fallacy in which the proposition to be proven is assumed implicitly or explicitly in the premise"

That's right. We _assumed_ that wearing a helmet makes you safer then we found some stats and hey, now it's proved.

So basically, this stat says nothing, though I will sip a few beers before I ride my bicycle. _That_ stat I believe.

Here's my favorite:

"More than 7 times as many bicyclist deaths in 2008 were males compared with females."

Thus, the most dangerous thing you can take with you on your bicycle is your pen15.

So now we are getting to the nitty gritty. Overall, I think that statistics suck and ought not to be used when making a decision. Stats are always coupled with the nebulous and made up notion of "safety" which is a weak person's way of taking away people's fun. If you want to tell me not to do something; own your opinion and tell me you don't like it, and that you somehow feel empowered to boss me around. Don't manipulate me with fuzzy math.

Hey, I am a bit pissed here.

OK, how about cost benefit analysis?

One way to look at this is to ask how often are head injuries caused by cycling.

We'll look at the <a href="http://cyclehelmets.org/1100.html">Bicycle Research Foundation</a> for answers.

"Cycling represents 7.1% of all head injuries."

I'm not a stats expert, but to me 7% is almost none. To put it another way:

"93% of head injuries occur when someone is NOT on a bicycle."

Seems like cycling is safer than not cycling.

What causes more head injuries than cycling?

Perhaps we should ask an <a href="http://www.pharmacology2000.com/822_1/page1.htm">expert physician?</a>

"Automobile (motor vehicle) accidents results in over half of all head injury"

So we are spending all this money on bicycle helmets, mainly to appease skittish, non-cycling motorists, when it turns out that they are SEVEN times more likely to have a head injury than a cyclist. That is, for every major head injury a cyclist gets, seven motorists also get a head injury.

Why motorists not wearing helmet?

Because that would be crazy right? Because it would be unsporting?

I'd ask <a href="http://rotoexperts.com/images/stories/newroto/myxr119_Dale_Earnhardt_Helmet.jpg">Dale Earnhardt Jr.</a> first.

But cars protect us right? Therefore, when motorists get head injuries they are not as severe as cyclists who are "exposed"?

Wrong.

From the same article, 70% of fatal head injuries are for motorists.

For a motorists to whine about how cyclists bring headaches to themselves; it's a bit silly when they have the greatest risk of a deadly head injury.

In fact, I'd postulate that if we want to maximize harm reduction, it's insane to target those least likely to get head injuries.

Thus, from a cost benefit analysis, bicycle helmets shouldn't be on the radar. 

This leads credence to my belief that those who are most vigorous of their support for helmets just hate cycling and are afraid to speak their minds. 

I know that this is getting long, but just to put things into perspective, what's the leading cause of traumatic brain injury in the US?

If you have been following my point of view, you'd know one activity which is NOT number one.

The  <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/TraumaticBrainInjury/causes.html">CDC</a> thinks it's falls which make up 35% of these terrible injuries.

Cyclists are not even on the list which means that they are buried inside some other stat.

But this raises the question, why, again, are people so gung ho about protecting cyclists against something that almost NEVER happens? That is, we almost never fall off our bicycles and hurt our heads.

So when I hear, "Why don't you wear a helmet?" here's what come to my mind.

"Why aren't there mandatory laws for motorists to wear helmets when most of the deaths by head injury are in autos?"

"Why are helmets even on the radar when accidents never happen?"

"Are there cases where helmets actually put cyclists at risk?"

"If safety is so important, why are we not focusing on eliminating what kills us the most which is bad motorists?"

I'll answer some of those questions as well as raise a whole bunch more in subsequent posts.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[We woke up the next day late. This was a pattern that we had repeated for much of the trip: going to be early and sleeping in.

It wasn't so much jet lag in that we were shifted in schedule, we were just exhausted all the time.

If figured that this was because we had been doing so much in San Diego that when we finally had a chance to not go to work and sleep in, our bodies took it. 

I would have thought that I'd be so excited to be in Europe, but perhaps it's because I'm older or perhaps Kopenhavn is just a really relaxing city. Who knows...

We tried to call Cecilia to no avail.

We rushed to get ready and went outside.

She was waiting outside.

Even saying "waiting" belittles what I saw.

If I hadn't known her, she could have been waiting or she could have chosen to pose, next to her bicycle behind our building next to the brick wall because she was in a photo shoot. She could have just decided to stand there and smoke.

She looked so calm and happy as if standing there was the most natural thing in the world as if she could stand there, happily all day until she rode home or perhaps to a local pub.

Of course, by "happy", I didn't mean grinning or laughing, but merely a calm contentment.

She did smile when we got there then she apologized as she was sleeping late, too.

Was the entire city under some kind of sleeping spell?

We took another glorious walk to her apartment where they served us a large and continuously coming breakfast.

The dishes were too many to recount and too many to consume.

However, I did remember getting pickled herring in both curried and non-curried kind on rye bread. There was also salmon, but this time on a different kind of rye with some kind of special spread.

The rule was that all the dishes had be assembled just so and eaten in the proper order.

I'm usually not a slave to rules, but for some reason I felt it was important to stick to the script.

Of course, the food was delicious. The Danish diet was made just for me, I believe.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Bike To Work (Not)</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/05/05/bike-to-work-not/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The premise of this blog is to combine happiness and bicycling, but I sometimes fall short of this promise.

Today, I'm going to continue in that tradition.

One might be surprised as a life long bicycle commuter that I am not enthused about Bike to Work Day.

Why?

Let me count the ways.

First of all, the whole notion of making this into a red letter day, to me is silly as it continues the stereotype that cycling to work is a fringe, niche activity taken up only by lunatic daredevils.

In order to discover if I find something offensive, one merely needs to search and replace bicycle with automobile.

Now we have Motor to Work Day.

Imagine riding in a Hummer to work! 

What a novelty to have everything catered to for once.

What a great day where one can ride, in comfort and relative quiet--you're making the noise so much outside with it.

Imagine going to everyone you know and bragging that you actually drove to work not unlike Dale Earnhardt.

Would anyone care of be impressed? 

No.

Would they think you are special?

Not in the good sense of the word.

They might wonder why you are going on and on about it.

This is exactly how I see people who rave about Bike to Work Day.

Also, I think that in a city like San Diego, Bike to Work Day is totally irresponsible because the streets are very dangerous in places.

Yes, I love my commute, people are nice, blah, blah, blah.

That's me.

Yesterday, when riding to a pizza shop, I was on College Ave, and I suddenly got my Europe Flu: nostalgia for a few weeks ago of glory where I could bicycle in a place where _someone_ in the city thought of me.

On College Ave, I felt like a daredevil idiot.

There's zero space on the road for someone. I'm not going to ride like an asshole and take the lane. That sucks for me and it sucks for the cars.

Bicycles, by their nature, are slower than cars, and I don't like to be rushed. I bicycle _slow_ because it feels good.

I don't like being dictated how to ride.

This is exactly what the VC people have done in the 30 years of anti-bicycle propaganda.

So I'll say it here, if you want to bike to work, do it. I'm not going to tell someone how to live their lives.

But I really caution for one for what one is getting into.

The city of San Diego hates cyclists. The drivers are nice, but the government sucks regarding cycling infrastructure because they never built any.

So if you want to Bike to Work so you can feel good about yourself and brag about that single ride all year, do it.

It's OK, we're not laughing at you, we're laughing with you.

And if someone mentions green house gas emissions, I'm going to gag. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[After breakfast, we headed outside where we were going to do some last minute touristing for the New Yorkers.

Since I was mainly there to see cycling, which I saw, and to ride bicycles which was going to happen, I was content to do anything. I really just wanted to spend time with Cecilia and her SO. I _would_ really have liked to see Hannah more, too, but that was not to be. Next time.

Once outside, Karina, one of the New Yorkers, wanted to take the bus instead of ride a bicycle again.

I was so excited! Now I would have a bicycle!

And I did.

It was a pink girls three speed with a really solid basket. I suggested to my SO that she get a basket just like it.

The bicycle was largely rusted and it felt like it weighed a hundred pounds. The handle bars were really short and dorky because it was stolen and this is the modification that the thief had made. 

A thief with bad taste, imagine that.

The best thing about the bicycle was the internal lock which pretty much all bicycles (and none in the US have). I have no idea why we don't explore this innovation in here. I know that it's not a permanent solution, but it is great for many cases.

The lock helped Cecilia get the bicycle back.

She saw the bike in a park, and she bravely approached the rider and asking to try her key to the lock. When it fit, she asked for it back. She got it back without a struggle.

Stories like these make me like our friends even more!

Even before we got started, I rode back and forth behind the three story apartment building in the cute courtyard which was almost completely filled by a line of bicycles. 

Beyond the courtyard, the neighbors had their laundry out to dry. Yet another sensible thing we almost never see in the US.

The sun was out and there was a light breeze. It wasn't too hot nor too cold just like a typical day in San Diego. 

Perfect day for riding.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Paseo de Todos: In Transit</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/05/09/paseo-de-todos-in-transit/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Last weekend, I went to Paseo de Todos again. 

I won't recount how excellent it is because there are too many other posts, and nothing really that different happened. Suffice it to say that it was a good time and well worth the trip.

However, this time, my good friend didn't drive down anymore.

I agree with not driving on so many levels, though, in the past, when I knew that there was a ride available, I jumped on it.

Now, with the van gone, I took the trolley.

It's possible to ride one's bike down there, but as my princess discovered, it was rough in some parts. For me, I just didn't want to make such a hard trek.

The trolley was actually really easy to pick up as it was just down the hill from my job.

The first train, green, was pretty easy, but I had to change the blue line. I did that as soon as possible.

Unfortunately, I found myself in a loop as I was actually on the orange line. Oops.

A passenger was nice enough to tell me what train to get on.

I switched trains in the beautiful downtown station. It was nice to see an urban area that was also San Diego.

On this train, two families merged. One lady with four or five children including a baby. One of the other children said about her, "That baby can fight good!" 

The other four children were by themselves. The oldest was ten, I don't know how old the youngest was: probably about five or so.

Anyway, one of the children had a bag of chips which he shared with all the others both in his family and the other children.

These children surrounded my bicycle. I told them they could hang on to it, and one child even lay his head back on the pannier.

My bicycle got really heavy with all the children hanging on it. 

I wanted to lean it against the wall, but some dudes who had been on the train since before I got on were leaned up against the wall, and they had prevented me from doing so. I made a note to be more aggressive about this in the future.

Finally, I changed trains again, and a preacher guy with a bible and cross would not move when I asked him politely so that I could put my bike against the wall. I explained that I was trying to be polite and I didn't want to get in the way. Then he ran off in a huff.

Next the conductor came and yelled at me to get out of the way because the train was changing direction. Usually, I would have been OK as bikes are relegated to the back of the train even though, I feel that they are better suited to the handicapped area as long as there are no handicapped people.

Where we stand currently blocks an entire door and puts us in the way of a large space especially if there are two bikes and when people don't allow us to put them against the wall.

Later on, as we rode the bus home, we noted that perhaps people hated bicycles so much because the so called accommodations are so inadequate that they put us in people's way and they "make people hate us."

I don't want to be in the way nor hated.


The children were as well behaved as one could expect especially the four who were alone.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[http://www.johnforester.com/LAW/Clarke.htm

This is a brilliant article in the way Coulter's books were brilliant: they have so many things wrong with them in such a small space that it's hard to start unpacking let alone debunking them so you kind of have to nod and agree.

I've had these discussions at parties where guys (usually) would dump their canned speech on me. 

It's like tangled ear buds. If you sit down long enough with it, you can straighten things out. 

Let's start:

"Clarke has opposed lawful, competent cycling throughout his career as the nation's most prominent bikeway promoter."

Wow, this sounds really awful.

First of all the word lawful is misleading. 

If we are proposing new public policy, it makes no sense to say that it's "unlawful" because whatever the policy is, that will be the law.

Similarly, other words are used in a weasel way to make this argument. In fact, this whole document reads like a ton of debate tricks.

One of the slickest debate trick is to accuse the other side of doing what you are doing. Thus, I bet any money that they accuse Clark of using a bunch of rhetorical legal tricks.

We'll see.

Out next word is "competent." 

Again, this is surprising that it's used here unless we know Mr. Forrester's background. He promotes "bicycle safety courses". 

Thus, Forrester is using the word "competent" in ways that are unusual. In this case, "competent" means that they used his product. If you took another bicycle course or figured things out for yourself, like I did, you are not considered "competent."

Thus if you ride your bicycle for ten years, but without training and have no problems you are not "competent" in the Forrester-verse. Similarly, if you take his class then go out and get killed, you are called a lot of names, but you are "competent" by definition.

If we delve deeper they will make the extra-ordinary claim that if you take their course, you are totally impervious to accidents. 

This is a bad thing to claim because it makes one lose credibility. Strangely enough, Mr. Forrester continues to have a negative impact on cycling.

By negative impact, I mean he actively discourages the majority of us from cycling. ]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I enjoyed reading your rebuttal of this article although I decided to not follow the link and read the article for myself.  I don't have the emotional energy to read this kind of stuff.  

I guess I straddle the divide being that I actively promote and teach a curriculum developed by John Forester.  I think that most of what we teach makes sense and is good practice on the current road conditions.  I know that you and your wife are very knowledgeably of the "Effective Cycling" curriculum and I have observed that you generally ride in a manner that would follow principles taught by the LAB.

Foresters views on cycling infrastructure and his approach to advocacy in my opinion are foolishness and very counterproductive to improving conditions for cyclists and for accommodating cyclists of all ages on the road.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Next thing I knew, we started riding. Finally, I was living the dream and riding my bicycle in Denmark!

Marcellus noted that I had a huge grin on my face.

How could I not?

I started playing around on my bicycle riding really fast to pass Marcellus. The gentleman that he was, he was going to allow me to lead, giving me directions as I went, but I am used to following on a bicycle so I allowed him to pass me again.

The ride was amazing. I was passed by many older women as well as all stripes of people. Everyone looked so glamorous except for us three American dudes.

I had a feeling that everyone knew that I wasn't from Denmark.

The ride was long, and when we got there, we were at a castle surrounded by a moat. We had to walk our bicycles through a park to get there.

I noticed that the trees had their tops cut off in a square shape so that each tree was exactly the same size. 

When we got to the castle, they had a "no bicycles" sign which felt a little weird seeing how open they were about bicycles in other parts of the country.

We ended up chaining our bicycles to the bench while at the same time setting the internal locks on our bikes.

Then we closed over the drawbridge which was down and entered the island on which sat the castle.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Wow, I spend an entire article on the FIRST SENTENCE.

I went from having no blog post ideas to having hundreds. 

I bow in gratitude to the great Guru Forester. :)

Here's the first sentence fragment:

"Although the public thought, and still thinks, that bikeways make cycling safe for those without traffic-cycling skills," 

Nice!

This is most likely something that makes Mr. Forester see red.

That's really sad.

The ideas that bother us the most are those which we believe are false, but _are likely to be believed_.

This is why if someone makes a crazy claim like he is the Nuclear Power god from Dimension X, we'd laugh.

But when we are told that the city just solved their traffic problems by adding a lane to the freeway we (some of us) cry.

The fact of the matter is, thanks to my good friends, I realized that often perception is more important in traffic than plain statistics. That is, if people feel safer, they are more likely to do an activity.

It just so happens, that it's actually a scientific fact that the more people ride, the safer all cyclists are.

This can be found by taking a look at the per capita riders vs. bicycle accidents. The more the cyclists, the less a single cyclist will get hit by a car.

Thus, while bike lanes don't magically make people immune to collisions, nobody actually believes that, they do make people safe indirectly by increasing ridership.

This is because humans, like all other organisms, respond to cues in their environment.

If the road is really loud, it feels unsafe.

If we get buzzed a lot, it feels unsafe.

If we have to "take the lane" from something that could come out of nowhere and kill us, it feels unsafe.

What to most of us do when something feels unsafe?

We don't do it.

What do crazy people do?

Join a cult that convinces them that the previous unsafe behavior is really safe.

"...it was known from the beginning of the bikeway movement that bikeways could not deliver on either of these claims: reducing accidents or eliminating the need for skill. Subsequent studies confirmed these initial analyses."

Notice that next fragment then the next sentence contradict one another?

How is something "known from the beginning" with out any kind of scientific study which is the standard that Mr. Forrester puts everything everyone else says?

We'll discuss the studies when we see them. I'm confused why, at this point, he didn't give one citation to back up his claims.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[It really scares me on how fun critiquing this paper is which is why I don't do this more often. It's like taking a drug, but instead of making you feel good, it just makes you look like an asshole.

"Therefore, bikeway promoters had to commit two ethical lapses in order to promote bikeways." 

Wow! Bikeway promoters are unethical!

Amazing.

What did they do?

Take bribes? Steal money? Kill people? 

Let's see:

"The first was to avoid any consideration of safety, because they could not produce any good evidence that bikeways made cycling safer."

OK, so bikeways are unsafe so they should be banned. 

Can't we say the same thing about guns, autos, and even bicycles themselves?

Isn't it safer to bicycle slowly so we can stop quicker and note obstacles than to ride as fast as possible? Shouldn't bicycle racing be banned? Perhaps we should just all stay in our houses?

By <a href="http://www.johnforester.com/">Forester</a>'s standard, the number one killer of children, private automobiles should be banned.

Instead of going after freeways which kills 38,000 people a year, he goes after bike lanes which kill zero people a year. In fact, since bicycles on the road actually make drivers safer, one can say, scientifically, that bike infrastructure saves lives. 

But it's unethical somehow.

"The second was to avoid any consideration of cycling skill, because they could not identify any item of cycling skill that bikeways eliminated."

OK, this is convoluted.

Hidden assumption: that cycling skill needs to be eliminated in order to build a bikeway.

That's strange reasoning.

I don't think that anyone would think that cyclists should "eliminate their skills" in order to justify bikeways.

I don't see how a skilled cyclist will have a problem with a bikeway.

What about an "unskilled" (meaning didn't take his class) cyclist.

In our current system, the Forrester's class takes 8 hours. Yes a whole fucking day to be competent to ride. In Copenhagen, the system that Forrester despises, I got a lesson on riding in a single minute. I felt fine riding after that.

We'll see more of this where Forrester makes a strange assumption that nobody really agrees with then runs with it.

Here's a typical patterns of his strange argument:

We have to do A before we can do B. 

Do we really? 

For example, you have to have one less skill from my made up class before you can build a bike lane.

What?

I postulate that we can build a bikeway regardless of skill. If skills are so great, we can always teach people the necessary skills later.

If you study other infrastructure, like the freeway, it was built before anyone knew how to use it which only make sense.

If something doesn't exist, you can't practice on it.

So I say that we should build bikeways all over the place as Forrester is kind enough to admit that we all want.

In a democracy, we should get what the most of us want not what our self-appointed guardians allow us to have.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Before I go on, I just wanted to post this link that my SO found:

<a href="http://www.labusinessjournal.com/news/2011/may/09/getting-gear-bikes/" title="Getting in Gear on Bikes"></a>. It basically debunks the myths that say that people shouldn't have access to bicycle facilities.

Getting back to the shadow boxing:

I liked this sentence:

"Clarke was the most prominent author of the government's documents justifying, more accurately excusing,  the nation's program regarding bicycle transportation, which consists almost entirely of bikeways."

After I read that, I licked my lips.

Great. Are we going to get a better alternative?

I'm always open to new ideas, and the US government, in general, is too.

So what do we get next from our guru?

"Clarke's aim was to reduce motoring by taking advantage of the public belief that bikeways make cycling safe for those without traffic-cycling skills."

At first, this seems harmless.

Clarke wants to reduce motoring. That seems good. 

There is a direct link between obesity and motoring, for example. So reducing motoring will reduce this.

Reducing motoring will reduce pollution which has been _scientifically_ linked to childhood asthma. Surely nobody can argue in favor of dirtier air.

Reducing motoring reduces chances of collisions and all the costs on society.

I could go on ad nauseum.

Oh, also, he wants to make cycling safe for those without "traffic-cycling skills".

Traffic-cycling skills == bought my product/took my class

Basically, Clark is a good guy.

But if you read the sentence again, it's more sinister. Clark wants to take advantage of public belief. 

Uh oh, he's a real monster, right?

Who else would take advantage of "public belief".

Except for anyone who has done any kind of real advertising and marketing campaign.

People's time is limited. We have to make our messages quick. 

People are resistant to tossing out their entire belief system after seeing a single advert. They are more likely to respond to something that goes along with what they all ready believe.

Not only that, but separating cars from bicycles actually makes them safer so we can stop with this whole belief non-sense.

So far, Mr. Forrester has convinced me that Clarke is a-OK.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I know it's been a while, but I'm going to finish this thread one day.

OK, I just crossed over a four lane road with two way traffic.

I ride past the trolley stop and an apartment complex.

The apartment complex doesn't look so nice and isn't really in a nice area, but from google maps, it appears to be very nice with a private pool.

Though, I said, I could breath a sigh or relief, I still have to watch out for cars backing out on the left, parallel parkers on the right, and people pulling out from two more driveways from the apartment complex. Oh, and the 24 Hour Fitness Parking Lot on the left. Really, it's a lot calmer than it sounds.

Then I go underneath an overpass, and I make it to Qualcomm stadium. 

From now on, it will not be downhill anymore: it's flat here, and then uphill for the rest of the trip.

The first part of the path often floods when it rains. Usually, though this is the first part to get cleaned out because sometimes they open part of the bicycle "trail" for automobiles to drive into the stadium parking lot.

To keep up with the trail, you need to stay on the right side because otherwise, you could go right past it into the gigantic parking lot.

Otherwise, you end up on the bike trail proper which is much narrower. On the right is a stream or tributary, but it sometimes dries up. Some days, though it smells salty so I feel like I'm riding near the ocean even though I'm actually many blocks away.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Today was a particularly wet morning, mainly because it had rained last night. One of the things I love about San Diego is that usually the heaviest rain is at night.

This morning, however, I had to pay for all this rain as it was so wet in the stadium parking lot. I rode far around the water, but it was still like riding in an inch of water i the worst places.

At this point, I had the dilemma of either going around the bike trail which probably had mud on it, but riding on a longer and steeper hill which had more traffic or toughing out the mud.

I chose to tough out the mud. 

Aside from the thin sheet of water flowing across the bike path, there was little to no mud.

At this point, I go beneath a few overpasses on a narrow windy trail.

At the end of it, I wind up on the next stage of the path which transitions from black tar to sidewalk. The sidewalk is actually much wider than the tar path, but the cracks in between the pieces of sidewalk make my bike bounce up and down. Really strange setup.

The freeway is up above on right while on the left is an oil rig which I love because I love to see our actual, real infrastructure. I find it ironic that in my cycling days, I get much closer to the production, storage, and distribution of oil than I do when riding an auto. At any rate, this is a kind of tourism or desirable view for me to see the guys loading up oil from huge tanks into their tanker trucks.

These drivers are almost always really sweet giving me an entire lane (on a one lane each way road) when passing my bicycle.

The trail soon ends. I estimate the whole "Qualcomm Stadium Bicycle Path" is about a quarter mile, but it's hard to say.

At the end of the trail is a cul-de-sac. By this, I mean it's actually an rounded end of the road, a "sac" like in the French use of the term, and not just a dead end.

There's usually some big item dumped here, sometimes in front of the trail entrance like a couch and other smaller things dumped. Also, there is at least one suspicious looking car. I wouldn't be surprised if I find a dead body or two here one day. It's basically a place for motorists to come and make out, do drugs, sleep or whatever else they do. Also, sshh, it's free stadium parking if you don't mind walking half a mile and of course getting here early as it fills up quite fast with cars illegally parallel parked along the road. I'm definitely NOT suggesting that anyone ban games because it attracts a bunch of scofflaws; I consider parking here to be a neat trick. However, the motorists, now pedestrians on the path are usually shocked and terrified to see a cyclist on the bicycle path. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>My Commute IX</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[After the cul-de-sac, I pass the only legitimate reason for a motorized vehicle to be on this road which is to go to the petrol storage facility.

I am careful here because there are often huge oil tankers exiting. Like I said before, they are usually great and kind drivers, but I prefer to yield to them right away because they are faster, and it's the polite thing to do.

Now it's a slight climb on a crumbly shoulder, but  you can take more of the lane here because, like I said, it's low traffic.

This road goes for a quarter mile or so until we get to a threeway stop. Here it's a bit confusing.

There's traffic that gets priority to go to the 15. Usually, there's not too much, but I can imagine it being a long, long wait to go straight during rush hour because "Oncoming traffic does not stop."

Except when it does which is slightly annoying, though people are trying to be nice, because it's hard to be sure. Also, they are faster, and I'm polite, too.

So I try to pay attention to see if someone's waiting for me.

Sometimes, I get impatient, and I do a bad thing which is to salmon in the bike lane on the opposite side. This is because nobody would make a turn to hook me.

Except when they do.

On the other side of the threeway, there's a golf course and traffic for that "Does Not Stop" either. Usually, it's easy to see the golfers because they are riding in the gutter because I guess a turn is that much faster, even in a single lane of traffic if you rub your tire against the curb. :)

Usually, it's not too bad going up this street except when there's a golfer leaving golf. For some reason they always surprise me. I try to keep aware of traffic behind me, but since the street is so little traveled in this direction, it feels almost pointless.

The other day, though, a car came out of nowhere. 

The next turn is a light. It's usually not too bad. The only thing is to gear down before the left because it's a rough climb.

This area has a super neat lawn for the big box stores that I ride by both on the right: Walmart, Petsmart, Albertson's and the left: Fry's.

For some reason, the big box store traffic is well behaved on this street, and it has a shoulder. 

At this point, I can really start to hear the soft rumble of the 15, and it's relaxing. On a good day, I'll let my mind rest of the sound.

Next I reach an area that is heaven by suburban standards, but to me is awful. It's a semi-gated community with green, but it abuts the freeway. There are large sidewalks, but there's little to do save for walk to the big box stores which sucks because there are no back ways. I really don't want to be a whiner here, but I guess different people have differing preferences. I'm just shocked that people live here at all let alone pay the rents they must charge.

But they do have a nice park which I can do merengue in during lunch. 

Dancing in the park anyone? :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>My Commute X: The Grand Finale and Big Reveal</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So I ride about another quarter mile at which is an easy climb until I get to a stop light. Despite the fact that there's almost no traffic on this road ever, there are three lanes: two driving, and a turning lane.

Compared with older European and East Coast cities, this is a marvel due to the huge difference in the road width. For example, "Broad Street", a huge central street in Philly has only two lanes and there's no dedicated green turning lanes at all because they don't believe in them. You just turn right or left when you can.

Thus, I am shocked that the city which continually cries poor would waste so much money on an empty road when then smaller and more used roads look like the moon. Why not have a single lane road? This road is parallel to the expressway and only should be used for going to the housing project--I mean apartment community. :)

Despite the low traffic, though, there is this one notion that occurs which I call magic traffic. This means that when one rides on a road which is very quiet with low traffic, you nearly never get passed and never see a car...until one gets to an intersection. Then traffic appears out of no where. I have no idea why this happens, but it's pretty consistent for me.

This is a little scary because like before, one gets a little complacent on a quiet road then out of nowhere there's a car. So I make sure to look over my left shoulder before riding across two mammoth and empty lanes to get to the turning lane.

Though this light does change, it usually happens when there's opposing traffic who are making rights on red. This is kind of dangerous. Meanwhile, when there's nobody coming the light stays red. 

So for safety sake, I actually just run it. Yes, I am admitting it here. The infrastructure leaves us completely out of the loop. Following the law can and will put you at risk at times. Plus it's a hassle. Plus, who benefits from this mindless law following?

I know there's the whole scofflaw cyclist thing, but I am just being a realist. We were given human minds which are capable of creativity and thought far beyond the norm. Doesn't it make sense, that, while not hurting anyone else, we use our mind to make ourselves most at ease and safest within reason?

Thus, I run the light when there's nobody around.

Things get better at this point. This is the most outrageous blog post yet. :)

When I make a left, I actually cruise up onto the sidewalk.

If someone's coming, I dismount. 

But nobody is coming because nobody walks around here.

I do pass a bus stop which at times forces me to dismount. Otherwise, I roll on the sidewalk, THE WRONG WAY for a whole block. 

Then I dismount and hit the button.

I walk my bicycle across the street. This one is even more mammoth. It could make one feel small and insignificant.

But being the only one outside the car, the most visible, and very proud, when I walk across the crosswalk, I keep my shoulders high. I walk normally, I do not like to be rushed. I think of myself as an actor walking in front of the paparazzi.

Sometimes, I make eye contact with the motorists all stuck in their little glass bubbles and smile. Often people smile back.

Before I get to the end of the crosswalk, there's usually high speed traffic trying to turn in front of me. I often step back and yield. Then I get onto the sidewalk again.

Then I ride up the hill, on the sidewalk, the wrong way until I get to my job.

Then I have to dart into 50 MPH traffic--this doesn't bother me while I am doing it, but writing it makes me feel like the designers are heartless assholes. 

May they be happy.

Then I wheel my bicycle around onto the turning lane. It's hard to describe, but it makes sense to me.

I wait for the 50 MPH traffic to wizz by on both sides until I can finally make my turn.

Then I climb one more hill to work. By this time, I'm smiling, the weather is usually nice. I am early almost always. Thus, I take my time going up the hill.

From time to time someone from work looks down and sees me seeming to struggle, but I'm not because I got it; I'm warmed up and just enjoying a slow climb. My princess taught me the value of enjoying a slow hill climb.

Finally, I roll into work. Before going into the building, I do a little weave in the parking lot just to enjoy the bicycle one more time just like I saw in the movie Basquiat. Sometimes, I even roll around the parking lot some more because it's so damned fun to ride, and I don't want to stop.

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Andrea went to a dinner for San Diego area transportation engineers.  A fellow engineer who happen to work for the city took it upon himself to do a little research because he was concerned because the city is considering changes to traffic light timing to improve conditions for bicyclists.  The statistics he showed indicated that delaying the timing of the lights would mean large costs to drivers.  His numbers were based on gas burned by cars idling at lights and the cost of peoples time wasted sitting in their cars.  The following speaker who was running for election in the organization commented on his talk ans said that she thought bicyclists are being giving, so much and that we really needed to find middle ground and not do something so extreme and wasteful as changing the timing of traffic lights around the city.

Andrea approached the Engineer who gave the lecture and shared that her perspective was different as she was a cyclists that often found getting through traffic lights in San Diego difficult.  She found that the other Engineer were receptive to her, but really had no clue what riding a bike in San Diego was like.  They thought parking in the garage on a level with no elevator access was a chore.

I also take offense to the idea of an argument against accommodation cyclists at traffic lights as being excessive considering there are four different lights on my commute to work that I routinely have to run at my own peril because they are not bike actuated, one of which has no pedestrian accommodations.  It hardly seems like the balance is even slightly tipped toward cycling in SD.  It seems more like it is "dangerous by design" to quote the article on pedestrian infrastructure that came out last week.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[There are three ways about this.

#1 Is to have an objective standard on what going "too far" means. I feel that by any standard: safety, money, health, amount of space, you'll find that bicycles are suffering very badly in the "war of attrition" that's cooked up in motorist's minds.

#2 Cyclists don't hurt motorists. This can be objectively proven. For example, I previously noted how motorists are a danger to cyclists, but cyclists make motorists safer. A couple of motorist children's lives are saved every year due to cyclists and traffic calming. This is hard to prove, but it's true.

Also, cyclists don't slow down motorists, but motorists do slow down motorists _and_ cyclists. This can be demonstrated objectively, and I made this argument in a previous post.

#3 I don't ever try to argue that I'm doing someone a favor by cycling. Instead, I turn the tables, and talk about how many great motorists there are and how kind they are to, me as a cyclist. Then I go on to thank them for giving us room on the road because I realize that to a motorist that's a huge sacrifice. I note that they are giving more than their fair share, but that's OK because they are kind and generous people, and I'm grateful.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Helmet/Safety Litmus Test</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[If helmets are so useless why such a push to get cyclists to wear helmets?

I don't really know their motivations.

It is true that mandatory helmet usage discourages cycling. This fact alone ought to have any serious advocate running and screaming away from mandatory helmets.

In fact, this is one of the main reasons why I eschew such gear, though there are many other reasons.

The big problem that I have with mandatory helmet laws is that they seem reasonable, but are actually inconsistant.

Here are some things I'd like to ask the pro-helmet law crowd:

1. If the vast majority of deaths by head injury (70%) are suffered by those sitting in an automobile, why are bicycles targeted when the minority of head injury death are cycling related. Oh, and half of serious brain injury is also suffered by motorists or their unlucky passengers. 

When I suggest helmets to motorists they laugh. I have the exact same feeling when I am told to wear a helmet on my bicycle.

2. Additionally, there are more head injuries off a bicycle rather than on a bicycle. So statistically more non-cyclists (and cyclists who are not currently riding) suffer head injury. In that case, shouldn't I put a helmet on after I get off my bicycle? If stats are to be believed, cycling is actually protective from head injury.

3. If cycling safety is really so important that we are going to spend millions of dollars on it, why not spend that money on the things that really hurt cyclists? The vast majority of bicycling deaths are due to collisions with automobiles. If we really cared, we'd do more to stop the motorists who are killing the cyclists.

Instead we give tickets to cyclists for their "protection". This makes me angry because they are obviously lying about caring about our safety.

If I want to protect someone, I don't take their money especially for doing something that, as I stated many times, is not even that dangerous to themselves or others.

4. This is to the racer crowd. In motoring, speed kills. I believe that the same is true for cycling. I feel much less safe when riding fast. I can't see so well, and I am forced to ride further out into the lane to avoid doors and pedestrians, things I usually can handle with aplomb when riding at a slower pace.

In fact, I'd postulate that many cycling accidents could be prevented if the cyclist rode slower and didn't use the streets as a race track. In fact, like motor racing, I think that racing gear and racing in general should be discouraged from the streets. 

I am much in favor of racing in race tracks. But what message does it send to motorists to ban NASCAR races from our streets then conduct bicycle races there?

It's unfair, and it fuels the anti-cycling attitudes more than any other mode of cycling.

Yet, the cycling community targets the homeless, who have no other way to get around, and older people who salmon out of misplaced "education" from the past that this is the proper way to ride.

So there you have it: four things that will reduce collisions and deaths in our roads much more than mandatory helmet usage.

This goes along with the cost benefit analysis of yesterday.

If you think about it, we are literally pouring good money down the drain in plastic sculptures of dubious value that make us all look like life-hating idiots instead of spending the money on things that will actually make us safe.

Now that this information is public, until these questions are asked and why such a waste is justified, I'll assume that the reason that people advocate for helmets is that they actually don't like cyclists.

In our current political climate, there's no reason why mandatory helmet laws will benefit cyclists.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[It does rather annoy me that when the subject of safe cycling is brought up the first thing brought up is wearing a helmet.  It even more annoys me that when a cyclists is struck by a vehicle at highway speeds weather or no the cyclist is wearing a helmet is often cited, what's the point?

I have taken to wearing mine when I intend to ride fast or in hazardous conditions where i might likely go over the handle bars (like mountain biking), but the smartest thing anyone can do is to prevent an accident.

At work we sell a wide variety of helmets and sometimes people think that if they spend more money they will be safer.  I quickly point out that this in not true.  The construction and materials of all the bike helmets that I know of are relatively the same, and they protect you when you impact the top of your head, no more.  I have not found that the expensive helmets offer any better quality or protection, they often are lighter and have more air vents.

I recommend the mulit-sport helmets for casual riders, because they offer more side protection and most importantly are more stylish.

Recently I was checking out Dottie's pictures of Critical-Lass, and couldn't help but think that they were a bunch of perfectly good looking women with ugly contraptions on their heads, many with lights and accessories attached.  Granted most of these ladies had some of the more fashionable helmets available, I just don't think that the helmet accentuates the human form.  I realize that this is not the point, but believe that looking good is important, and likely affects how you and others behave on the road.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'd argue that "looking good" makes you safer than having a piece of plastic on your head.

I saw this with my own eyes. 

If you have much more passing distance, people yield for you more, and they respect you more, you will be safer.

It's thousands of times more safer to NOT get hit at all then to get hit and have a helmet on.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Kopenhavn XI: Tivoli</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm getting sick of my shadowboxing, argument posts so I'll post some more memories of my wonderful trip.

We were last seen on the fortified castle.

As I crossed the moat, I thought, "there really was a time when a small swimming pool was enough to deter the military. Wow!"

Once on the island, the whole "compound" was smaller than I thought. The castle was beautiful and amazing, but I also thought that if I felt like I needed this to protect me, I certainly would have realized that I made a wrong turn somewhere in my life. Yuck!

Cecilia negotiated with the people in order to get us in the castle, but it turned out to be far too many Kroners, and not enough fun to be worthwhile.

So we had to figure out what to do next. 

Nobody really knew what they wanted to do.

I normally would have expressed my idea, but the NYC couple only had a single day left so I deferred to them.

We finally figured out what to do and once again broke off into two groups: the bicycle group (me here!) and the bus crew (everyone else).

We rode to Tivoli which is a really, really old theme park.

Underneath the gaudy exterior is a beautiful old style park. The decorations are standard for theme parks with things like giant eggs (it was soon Easter) and so on.

There were even jungle noises in the bathroom. Only later did we realize that the whooping when you make a big one is not pre-programmed. We knew this because through Cecilia, of course, we met the art designer of Tivoli. So overall, the decorations of Tivoli were awesome. :)

In Tivoli, we had a traditional theme park time where we walked as couples, awkwardly like on first dates or something.

I did manage to swing some coffee ice cream which was great.

Otherwise, my princess and I, as huge intellectuals, didn't really feel the need to engage in much of the park. It was more like anthropology (the field not the store).

Until, of course, the swings.

The swing set is a large spire that can be seen from far away from Tivoli. It's like the Space Needle of Seattle (which doesn't actually shoot you into space or anything). :)

For a few kroners, they will strap you into a swing. Actually you strap yourself in. The wires which hold the whole thing up have links that look like reinforced paper clips. The bars are cheap aluminum tubes. 

I'm guessing that the shoddy workmanship is deliberate to make a routine ride insanely scary. All I could think of as we were brought up over the city was the links breaking. Well, I guess it was time to die.

Then they spun us which shouldn't have been surprising, but I wasn't paying attention. I immediately grasped my glasses.

So there I was with a perfect 360 degree view of Kopenhavn, and all I could do is hold my glasses and pray for the stupid thing to get my down before the wires broke.

Of course, I survived as did NYC couple who got me into this whole mess.

The rest of the day was an exercise in gratitude for still being alive.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>The Mechanical Guru</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the most useful Buddhist teachings, I have read, is to treat your enemy as your guru.

This is really, really difficult because if you really take this seriously, you will have the utmost respect for this person.

Why would you want to do this?

The way I see it, just like the advice of Christ of "turning the other cheek", I see this as a way of eliminating anger, and thus eliminating suffering in one's own life.

Now, I don't advocate being a push over, or letting anyone get away with something wrong. Quite the contrary. 

I'm not shy to put myself first when necessary.

However, there's something really magical about practicing compassion, and I think that all cyclists should show motorists some respect and even some love.

It's a very adult thing to do to treat someone well who wishes to disrespect you; I think that is what makes the bigger person.

This is the toughest thing in the whole world to do.

However, today, I would like to thank the motorists who are easier to love, those I call "protectors".

There's a certain practice in the bicycling community that I have not seen elsewhere.

This has happened to me a few times that I was aware of, and probably more times than I know.

Basically, an automobile, driving behind me, will block the lane for me.

A friend of ours did this when my princess and I were transporting a solar oven up hill on University Avenue. They just took over the lane, in their car, and they stopped all traffic while we made it up the hill.

Another guy has a pickup truck, and he will similarly use it to cruise behind a cyclist who is in a tough place, effectively protecting them.

The other day while I rode down Florida Street into the canyon, a woman blocked the lane and rode half a city block behind me at a snail's pace, all for my safety. I knew this was true because she stayed back there until it was safe to pass and only passed when I prompted her to do so.

So, basically, all around me are wonderful little angels protecting me, and my fellow cyclists. Also, there are tons and tons of "Road Guru's" who are there to teach us forgiveness and patience.

Over and over again.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The other day when I did the excellent <a href="http://www.sdbikeunion.org/2011/05/photos-from-bike-boulevard.html">Bike The Blvd</a>, I met a new friend who had a problem with his back wheel getting stuck over and over again.

I stopped a few times to help him fix it. It was obviously a bad skewer which wouldn't ever seat properly again. I told him to gear way down before he peddling and to avoid using too much pressure. I also offered for him to come over to my house to borrow a skewer or bicycle.

He marveled at my bike fixing skills. The funny thing is that I consider myself terrible at it.

For one thing, unlike many people I know, I hate fixing things. I don't see the fascination; I just want stuff to be fixed. I work way better with things you can't see or touch like words or computer code. :)

Thus, I was happy to hear that somebody thought I was good at bike repair. I have been working on them for over a dozen years.

Each time I work on a bicycle, I get a little better.

The best lesson, however, I have learned was in watching not what people do when they fix a bicycle, but _how_ they approach it.

The best repair people actually enjoy the job. Thus, I try to enjoy myself, also. Second, they are extremely patient which is probably related to #1. If they enjoy themselves, it's easier to stick with it rather than trying to rush through it. Third, they tend to really pay attention to the situation rather than rushing in and trying things. Fourth, they make small changes and see how that impacts the system.

I'd like to add something that I do which is to read up on the subject before I try _anything_. This is tough, but it's well worth it. If you know _why_ you are doing things rather than just what to do, you can fix things much easier.

Over the years, I have grown a little more confident in fixing my bicycle, although I still appreciate it when my princess works on it. It's funny, to me, how many dudes are floored that she fixes my bicycle as if having female anatomy made this impossible or something.

However, as a few of my earliest bicycle repair mentors were women. They were the first people to explain the thought behind the repairs to me, also many of them exhibited the type of patience necessary to become really good mechanics.

The point is that anyone can learn to repair their bicycle if they care to do so.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday, enroute to a cycling based activity--are there any other? :)--I rode my bicycle through Sea Port Mall.

Actually, officially it's a village, but it misses the two things that every actual village has: people and decent food.

Am I the only person who is totally pissed off and fed up with the misappropriation of English words and their use in completely wrong ways?

An example of how obnoxious this is, imagine me telling people I'm a doctor because I read a book on medicine and that I'm a billionaire because I have a bank account. Oh, and because I ride a bicycle, I'm a pilot. I pilot my bicycle. :)

Anyway, while riding in Sea Port Village, I found something that I San Diego said was impossible due to fire codes, traffic codes, building codes, crime safety issues, and general NIH mentality: a walkable community.

Here were people from all walks of life of all races and classes together in one place. Everyone was fairly happy.

Oh, there was also, something else which I had been told were impossible: dedicated walking and bicycle lanes. That's right. On a pedestrian walk, there was striping for bicycles only which is great because pedestrians and bicycle traffic ought not to mix. They go at much different speeds, and often the cyclists are obnoxious riding too recklessly. (I don't do these things).

Oh course, the bicycle lane was impossible to ride in for any length of time because there were pedestrians who walked there and would not budge even though they saw me.

I quietly went around them because I realized that they were just having a nice day with their families and they didn't need to be bothered. Plus, it was nice to see some people who weren't obsessive about the law. Finally, the whole thing was a break for me. 

I could have taken the main road if I needed to speed. What I wanted was a relaxing day, too, so I walked my bike when things got too crowded.

Anyway, I had a wonderful ride at Sea Port Village yesterday. I always enjoy my time there. I don't know why, but I love to be around a lot of people especially people I don't know. I love to see families have happy days together.

If only they actually allowed people to live there making Sea Port Village not only a village, but San Diego's most walkable community.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Forester Vs. Clarke V</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/05/31/forester-vs-clarke-v/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Forester Vs. Clark V

OK, to recap from last time:

"Clarke's aim was to reduce motoring by taking advantage of the public belief that bikeways make cycling safe for those without traffic-cycling skills."

Moving on:

"Clarke achieved a double object by persuading his contracting officer to substitute encouragement for safety as criteria in the first document."

We covered this:

more cyclists == more safety (for both motorists and cyclists, actually)

On the other hand,  long time readers know that I don't really give two shits about safety. :)

"Clarke then established a system which largely ignored cyclists with traffic-cycling skills (Advanced Bicyclists) while establishing a ubiquitous bikeway plan for those without traffic-cycling skills, who needed to be encouraged (Basic Bicyclists and Child Bicyclists)." 

I have no idea what this means, actually, but we'll struggle together.

First of all, Forester creates this imaginary category of Advanced Bicyclists who are the sole keepers of traffic-cycling skills. I all ready covered how this is to push a product.

However, I'd like to further examine the whole notion of Advanced Bicyclists. I don't believe that they exist because there is a continuum of cyclists with skills. We are all learning and trying to better ourselves. That is until we get too old to ride. When I get too old to ride, I'll hang up my hat and stop writing about bicycling because there will be, no doubt, people who are younger than me who have mastered everything I know and move beyond it. Thus, I'll just look like an old fool pontificating from my wheelchair. If I break this rule, people, shoot me. :)

Where do we draw the line on what is "Advanced" cyclist and Unadvanced cyclist? 

Actually, I don't see the point of doing this. In Copenhagen, everyone rode, and it was fine. 

"Traffic Safety" skills took a minute or two instead of eight hours or whatever Mr. Forester's class takes.

When I started riding in Copenhagen, I was a bit shaky and nervous which is good. My nervousness made me aware, and it kept me safe. In a few minutes, I felt way better and I was all ready out running the leader of the ride in a fun loving way. After the first ride, I had a good idea of how to ride around the city.

Thus, I'd welcome any system that "ignores" Advanced Cyclists.

However, I do question whether more infrastructure "ignores" anyone.

If I really did think of myself as an "Advanced Cyclists"--which I don't because I don't have the ego to--I'd be able to ride safely and comfortably anywhere. 

Mr. Forester, however, needs special LACK of infrastructure to feel safe. That is, his class teaches us to be afraid of infrastructure.

I consider this to be very ominous indeed. Very bad. 

To me, to be a good, safe, fun or whatever cyclist, one needs to be flexible. 

Weather could be different. The road could get slippery. Drivers could fall asleep. Bike lanes end. Drivers pull out in front of us without looking.

What's the key to being safe in all these circumstances?

It's not training. 

It's actually easy. SLOW THE FUCK DOWN!

Seriously, if you want to feel safe, slow down. Nobody ever got killed getting into an accident at 8 miles an hour helmet or no.

In fact, I bet if you broke down the risk of death, the number one thing that killed someone was speed, the speed of the automobile or the speed of the cycle or the speed of both. In fact, I bet that helmet wouldn't really be that important because nobody dies at a slow, slow speed. 

OK, the last sentence was hyperbole. Because one never ought to say never. People moving at zero miles an hour fall over in the store and crack their heads on the floor and die. Nobody thinks that everyone should wear a helmet at all times not even the helmet industry. Think about it. 

If you EVER see someone--even the CEO of the "walking helmet" club--wearing a helmet to a bar and on the street, you'd want to institutionalize him. 

I never heard Forester address this point. That's because he wanted (he doesn't ride anymore) to ride as fast as possible and that's what he's pushing. Racing on the streets which requires no infrastructure and lots of helmets. I wish he'd take off his mask, and you'd see the real person. He's pushing for something I was against in an earlier post: street racing. If we eliminated street races of bicycles--just like we have with cars--all this safety shit would be irrelevant just like it is where there's decent infrastructure.

Besides a slow speed, the one other thing that helps in making cycling safer is experience. 

Helmets pushing and fear mongering plus lack of infrastructure is denying millions of us the thrill and cost savings of riding our bicycles to work. It's also denying us experience.

How many people have you heard that have said that they no longer bicycle because the last time they did they got into an accident? Many.

Why can't they press on? They are very afraid because of all these safety gurus. 

I had an accident. My princess had an accident. We all have accidents. The point is that we should make this OK to happen. We should be OK with these small scrapes. Slow speeds and lack of cars running us over makes it OK to fall from our bicycles.

We need to realize that this won't happen over and over again. We'll become better riders, and we'll become "Advanced Cyclists". 

Just kidding. 

We'll just be a little further along on the experience continuum.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA["The encouragement worked because people thought, particularly when encouraged by Clarke's propaganda, that bikeways made cycling safe for beginners and children. "

This is actually true. Again, one merely needs to go to places where we have better infrastructure. Any words don't really matter when you can just experience it.

"That meant an even stronger incentive to eliminate consideration of vehicular-cycling skills..."

This assumes that the majority of cyclists have vehicular skills and are as stated in last post "Advanced Cyclists". 

In fact, the majority of Americans, and indeed the world are NOT advanced. 

Thus, it's kind of funny to say we are eliminating something that wasn't really that popular to begin with. 

Plus, he sounds really sad that we don't need these skills anymore. I'd actually think that to need less skill is a good thing.

When we invented modern agriculture and refrigeration, we eliminated the need for hunting skills. Millions of Americans can and do still hunt, which is great, but we don't need to. Similarly, if someone wants to teach his course and people want to take it, they can. 

Thus, it's actually not being eliminated at all. Rather, we have less of a need for it is all. This is a good thing unless you invented it, of course.

"...when Clarke had to explain, or more accurately excuse, the scientific basis for the program, in the third document."

No. We don't need a scientific basis for the program. Riding a bicycle should be fun not "scientific."

"He had to eliminate consideration of vehicular-cycling skills because, if the public had to accept that even these beginners and children had to learn vehicular cycling skills to use the B/C bikeway system, the whole thing would go down the drain."

But previously, he argued that bikeways do eliminate the need for skill. Or did he?

I'm starting to get confused on what he said.

I do recall how he, in his book, _Effective Cycling_ (sic), that he almost crashed three times in half an hour on a bike path which meant that bike paths were dangerous. 

Having taken bike paths, daily, for over a decade without a single accident, I'd say that if someone almost crashes thrice, _they_ are the problem, not the path. I would NOT want this person teaching me a "bicycle safety" course.

So chalk me up for being totally lost here.

"This explains the skillful mendacity with which Clarke finesses these two issues, but which can be disclosed by a close reading of his official writings that implement national policy as set by Congress."

This only thing I really cared for in this sentence was "mendacity". As an intelligent person, I love to learn new words, and I didn't know what this one meant.

It means, "the quality or state of being mendacious."

OK.

Mendacious means liar.

So basically Clarke is a liar.

I can't parse the rest of this so Forester wins.

But Clarke is not a liar. Or rather, I didn't see him lie yet. And if he is a liar, he's probably not a bigger liar than the rest of us ordinary sinners.

Except Forester, of course who's perfect and never lies. ;)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>More Sea Port Village</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I don't have too many guilty pleasures because I don't have too much guilt in my life.

However, when I really examine my feelings, I realize that Sea Port Village is one of them.

Previously, I had stated that it is not a village, but it could be.

Another reason, I am guilty about loving it is how annoying the shops are. I have no problems with being a tourist in my own town nor do I have trouble catering to tourists. Heck, I used to do so myself.

However, there's a fine line between touristy good and a amalgamation of everything I loathe and Sea Port Village's shops are closer to the later. This isn't unlike the cheesy "Main Street" in Mall of Georgia despite the fact that a few traffic chocked highway miles away is a beautiful and neglected real downtown.

I really try to avoid complaining on this blog, but hey, I guess that's guilty pleasure number two of the day.

The sickening sweet smell of cookies is another turn off from Sea Port's decor.

Another thing is the "Viking Store" which I hadn't gone into, but I had a review from my Danish friends.

They apparently went there and had a laugh.

The things that were supposed to be Danish were actually either Dutch (wooden clogs) or German (clothes). I give this store an "A" for trying. Plus, it's just good family fun.

But a bad way to learn about the world.

<img src="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/sea-port-viking.jpg" alt="Sea Port Viking Store" />

Aside from the coupling of the coolest urban layout in the entire city of San Diego, and arguably the worst retail choices, the other thing that blew me away was the bike infrastructure.

<img src="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/blocked-bike-path.jpg" alt="Blocked Bike Path" />

By infrastruture, I mean that there's actually a bicycle path which is separate from the pedestrian area. As I said in earlier posts, if you combine it together, it becomes either a defacto parking lot path (as is part of the OB Bike Path) or a defacto dog walking path.

I have no beef with a path to get to a parking lot nor a quiet place to walk dogs. 

I do, however, disagree that we can't call a path "bicycle infrastructure" if it isn't for bicycles as we can bicycle on most city streets, but we don't call that "bike infrastructure". Nor do we allow pedestrians on the freeway.

So, sure, mix it up, but I think that most of us are happier when pedestrians, motorists, bicycles, and trains all run on separate tracks.

I did think it was funny how people just stood in the middle of the bicycle path when the pedestrian path was much larger and the paths were clearly labeled. I just know that none of these people would ever call a cyclist a scofflaw nor suggest that they stay where they belong. :)

Overall, though, the families were a wake-up call that I needed to slow down so I walked my bicycle and enjoyed the view of the bay.

I finally did make it to my destination which was a party where I was by far, the least cool dresser. What can I say? I'm just not into clothes.

Since I didn't know too many people, I played the games which were great social facilitators.

Many people introduced themselves.

<img src="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/dodge-ball.jpg" alt="dodge ball" />

Friendliness is definitely San Diego's strong point.

Later on that night, we relocated to an undisclosed location where I made a few new friends talking about dog training, Melville, Camus, and Sartre.]]></content:encoded>

I agree that bike paths should be separated in a way that discourages faster and slower traffic from constantly using the same space.  However, it does argue for the relative safety of bikes that some people feel that the OB bike path is a suitable place to sleep.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Actually, I am mostly OK w/ sharing space with cars and pedestrians. This is not an ideal world, and one is happier if one is generous. 

The only bone of contention for me is to call something that used for sleeping and walking dogs as "bicycle infrastructure".

There's something inside of me that doesn't like inaccuracy. I just don't know why it's so hard for so many people to admit that we don't have a lot of dedicated bike infrastructure, and that it's actually most all shared.

The only way it is _not_ shared is if pedestrians, motorists, and nappers are prohibited by law and this is enforced.

This is done on the freeway right now for motorist's comfort.

I don't _need_ this nor am I even sure I really want this, but I don't like things to be inaccurate.

If I say I'll give you $100, but then I stipulate you have to share it with whomever asks, whenever they ask, you won't be happy to hear that I gave you $100.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Forester vs. Clarke VII

"Clarke has opposed lawful, competent cycling throughout his career." 

Note, how Forester combines the two together?

He actually believes that his course is the only competent cycling. Not only that, but his course teaches lawful cycling.

Thus, it is implied, strongly, here that if you have not taken Forester's course, you are cycling illegally!

"He argues that bikeways eliminate the need to learn vehicular cycling skills." 

This is so true. Saw it in Copenhagen.

"He evaded the issue of safety by causing the federal government to change its policy criterion from safety to increasing the numbers of cyclists." Because he knew that bikeways were not safer than roadways, he finessed his way around that issue by misstating and denigrating the work in bicycle transportation engineering that demonstrated the safety and value of vehicular cycling." 

OK, we know that bikeways are actually safer. Of course, Forester has no data saying bikeways are dangerous. Also, like I said before, we actually like vehicular cycling. There's nothing wrong with it. However, it's like any other martial art, you are most happy and successful when you don't need to use it.

"This is the man whom the League has hired, and then promoted, as its Executive Director, a mendacious person who is utterly opposed to the original purpose of the League, which is to improve cycling for lawful, competent members." 

This sounds great, but it's vague. I have to skip some things because I covered them at least once before.

The worst word here is "improve" which means nothing. 

Unless, of course, he means that we must force everyone to take the lane on high speed roads and to take a day long class before being allowed on a bicycle.

Still, that won't change things for the original members will it?

And to improve things you need to change things. 

But Forester and his crowd oppose changes so it's kind of hard to see where they want to improve things.

"A League management who has done this must be utterly opposed to that original purpose, and ought to be dismissed by the membership."

Not necessarily. Goals change. We learn things and we "improve" ourselves.

"Like practically all federal documents regarding bicycle transportation (after the Cross study of car-bike collisions), this is another attempt to justify the government's program of incompetent cycling on bikeways. While the word "safety" is in its title, Clarke managed to change the contract to ignore safety. The original contract required emphasis on safety, but since there was no scientific knowledge demonstrating that the program made cycling safer, Clarke managed to get the emphasis changed to increasing bicycle use while ignoring safety."

I haven't read the original documents, but I kind of doubt that anyone would actually say that they want to "justify incompetent cycling."

Again with the science.

We can't do anything if there's no "science" behind it. But we need to conduct experiments to get the science. But that would be doing something, and we can't do it. Ug. Going in circles here.

I am starting to really, really love the crazy version of Clarke that Forester is creating. Let's toss out the nutty circular reasoning the  vehicular cycling, safety, and science and bloody DO SOMETHING. Later on, we can collect data and see if vehicular cycling is necessary. 

I feel it won't be and that "safety" will occur organically and without effort.

"Clarke states that older cyclist advocates "believe bicyclists should have knowledge and skills needed to operate a bicycle in the traffic conditions" of normal streets: Advanced Cyclists. However, writes Clarke, "increasing bicycle use means attracting new users and those new users will often not be willing to share roadway lanes with motor vehicles": Basic Cyclists and Child Cyclists. Clarke quotes various policy documents supporting a national policy of increasing bicycle use, and most of the document uses this as the criterion. Those bicycle owners who can operate in traffic, Advanced Cyclists, don't need encouragement, but they are only 5%. The 95% of Basic Cyclists and Child Cyclists need encouragement. "Given that the stated policy goal is to increase bicycle use, a supply-driven (as opposed to a demand driven) approach of providing special bicycle facilities to increase bicycle use (i. e., 'if you build them they will come') is warranted." This means that every street with more than minor traffic that serves any place that an average person might want to reach should include a bikeway."

I totally agree with Clarke here. We need to worry about the 95% of people who are too scared to cycle. I talk with these people everyday who look at me wistfully as I strap on my non-existent helmet and head out onto the road.

I'd love a bikeway everywhere.

"That is, he knew that bikeways attracted unskilled cyclists because these cyclists thought that bikeways made cycling safe for them. Naturally, Clarke was not about to upset that attraction, either among the public or among politicians. Failing to tell the truth that it is your duty to tell is equivalent to lying. Clarke therefore is a liar, and the government's whole program for bicycle transportation is based on lies."

News flash. Everyone, even those who have just taken the Forester safety class are still unskilled. The only thing that gives us skill is actual experience in the real world. The only way to get that is to start cycling. If we oppose that then we oppose any chances of real skill. So there's no problem with attracting "unskilled" cyclists to cycle because this is how they get competent. Jeez!

Plus, based on this bizarre definition of liar, I don't think that Clarke is a liar. 

Basically, Forester is saying that "if Clarke doesn't include the stuff that would torpedo his project based on my course, Clarke is a liar." 

Clarke is actually really cool.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Do It Yourself?</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I have always had a problem with the phrase "do it yourselfer", and today I finally figured out why.

I guess that's because I really, really like doing things myself, probably because I have a lot of pride.

Over the years, I have suffered a lot with poorly working bicycles and nights I wanted to write my award winning novel--still not written--instead of slaving over my bike.

Also, as I said before, I was impatient and unwilling to spend the money for the proper parts and tools all the time.

Looking back, it's a recipe for disaster. 

But as I said, I am semi-competent in keeping my own two wheels on the road thanks to some special people who helped me.

Still, there's this stigma against those of us who do _anything_ on our own. I think this is partially created by "professionals" who, of course, want us to pay them every time something goes wrong on our bicycles.

Now, I love my mechanic, but sometimes, on the road, we need to know how to fix things ourselves.

Thus, I don't think that there's a big divide between those who want to fix things themselves and those who go to a shop because we do both.

I love get my bike fixed at a shop when I ride it, and it is way smoother than I could ever make it. I love knowing everything is just right.

Still, for me, there's nothing like that sense of accomplishment such as when I adjusted my front derailler just so.

Also, since San Diego is so spread out, it's literally miles between public trans options, sometimes, and even more miles to the nearest bike shop. Thus, unless I want to take a hike, I need to carry a few tools, and have some basic proficiency in using them.

In the future, I'll share the little I know.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[One way of improving my bicycling experience either when I feel sad or when I am in a noisy and smelly shoulder is through meditation.

One of my favorite styles is Mindfulness of the Body.

I combine this with setting my sights on a distant point like a piece of garbage on the road. Obviously, do this at your own caution. If I am riding in a door zone then the next door that could hit me is obviously my object for sight.

At the same time, I focus on the subjective feeling of the parts of my body.

I used to start at the crown of my head, but now I start with my feet.

I find that the first effect of this is for me to enjoy myself more because cycling, especially in Southern California is naturally enjoyable.

Next, I become concentrated. Again, this is a good feeling.

Additionally, I begin to realize how my riding style is hurting me. For example, I tend to put a lot of pressure on my palms. Once my awareness reaches this, I sit up and put less pressure there.

Often my back hurts, and this mindfulness makes me realize that so that I can change my position and to feel better.

Finally, the noise and the smell does not disappear, but it fades to the background.

Additionally, my personal problems and internal critic are muted as I focus only on the sweet sensations of riding my bicycle.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Let's Get Buzzed</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I have been riding in the bus a little more lately due to an injury of my princess as well as general comfort reasons. Yes, I actually see riding the bus as a "luxury item" and motoring even more so. For some, though, one has to be absurdly affluent to bicycle, which I think is a positive image and ought to be encouraged. 

Anyway, as a bus passenger, I saw a bus passing a bicyclist a little bit closer than I would have. The cyclist looked very vulnerable. I feel that one would have to have the heart of Charles Manson to put someone's life at risk for so little gain. If I were driving, I'd give them much more room, at least three feet which is becoming the standard in many states. I'd also slow down, but not too much. Plus, I'd make no indication of recognizing the cyclist at all. Not a little encouraging beep nor a thumbs up as these things are all incredibly confusing and irritating to cyclists.

But no, the bus just buzzed the cyclist--who was hugging the side of the road as it was--then moved on.

As a cyclist, I have been buzzed many, many times.

I often wonder why motorists do it.

Are there really that many cruel and heartless humans in this world?

I think not.

My main understanding is that it's a form of alienation that occurs due to the nature of motoring with its windscreen that looks like a computer monitor. The controls make it look like a game. And the ease at one travels soon turns to boredom which actually can make people irritable and impatient. Finally, there's a total lack of empathy for the cyclist due to the lack of legitimacy that the media creates around cycling even though it's actually a totally legal and respectable way to get around.

When we rode in the country, the farmers in pickup trucks always gave us an entire lane. We felt that this was true because they often rode in slow vehicles (farm equipment) and thus had empathy for others even those who were slightly different.

Conversely, once when I was a car passenger, a friend of mine came an inch away from hitting another car in order to move around it. Once I saw this, it dawned on me that motorists are always getting really close to one another at high speeds. But they don't think of "buzzing" one another. It's just an acceptable risk to take. Despite the fact that in comparison with activities that are seen as suicidally dangerous, motoring is several orders of magnitude MORE dangerous.

For example, 111 US citizens died in Mexico in a year which made the US State Dept put out a travel advisory. At the same time, 3000 Californians died in motor vehicle accidents. Making motoring at least 30 times more deadly than going to Mexico.

So often, one is buzzed by a motorist who thinks nothing of it.

Contrast that to how careful a motorist is when there's a ditch. I have seen motorists go over ten miles over the speed limit in a one way street, narrowly hit a few people who were crossing then come to a screeching halt so that the bottom of their vehicle didn't get scraped.

Again, they are not really selfish, hostile, nor callous, but I think that the situation, the mental framework that they are stuck in--a caste system where the most dangerous vehicle gets the right of way--is what causes their behavior. A few different environmental cues such as bicycle lanes and leaders who support cycling, and you will see people behaving much differently.

No matter how special people like to believe that they are, we have the same DNA, the same general wants and fears.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Genealogy of a Buzzcreep</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Continuing the previous post on buzzing...

Initially, this post was there to cheer up those who have been buzzed while cycling and to give them the tools necessary to not only withstand buzzing, but to actively use the negative energy of cyclists in order to grow psychologically and to thrive just like an energy draining creature who gets more powerful the more you attack her. 

However, I got caught up making this a bit sadder than I wanted so you can skip this if you want to learn something today or to be cheered up.

Often overlooked in the whole buzzing thing is our feelings and why we feel the way we do.

First of all, I'd like to quote Buffy who said, "All my emotions are complete assets."

I love this quote, and I live it, but I must admit that it's only partially true.

Still, I feel that one's feelings are important, and that they are all good even anger and depression. No one is responsible for how one feels because no one can control it.

This is why it makes me angry when people who are in a good place in their lives, who have no problems tell me to "relax" or "chill out".

It's idiotic to expect someone, like a robot, to control their emotions.

On the other hand, one is 100% responsible for one's _actions_ regarding their emotions.

Just because something feels like a good idea at the time doesn't mean that one won't live to regret it--or die trying.

All this is obvious to every reader, but then again, it's NOT obvious on the roads otherwise nobody would get buzzed.

Think about it, what's the benefit to buzzing someone?

Satisfaction of "teaching someone a lesson"?

There's no satisfaction that can't be gained some other, better way like helping the homeless. If someone wants to "teach a lesson", they can tutor GED students or join Big Sisters.

It's like that scene in Pulp Fiction, "What's wrong, Ringo? Do you think that this is the first time that someone pointed a gun at my head?"

In the same way, experienced cyclists get buzzed all the time. We don't learn anything from it other than to stereotype all drivers as douche bags. 

Since I have many, many lovely friends who drive, only, I know that the above isn't the case. But this is what's being taught in the class of the buzzcreeps.

While the upside of teaching someone a lesson by buzzing them has the opposite of the intended effect. What's the downside?

Mainly a few years in prison. Others have been beat up when they get stuck at a light--I totally recommend against this and violence of any kind. Still others, those who still have active, working consciousnesses, got years of guilt that could only be drowned with drugs.

Thus, the conclusion I draw is that those who buzz other people are not acting rationally.

Deep down they believe that they are good people and that they are doing the world a better place.

In reality, they are acting in a childish and an emotional manner which can not lead to any good. They are risking prison time for a little bit of pleasure at someone else's expense.

Or they just aren't paying attention which means that they are again, showing bad judgment, either by trying to make their ride more entertaining or because they lack the physical or psychological abilities necessary to drive in a safe manner.

How sad.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Feeling Buzzed</title>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Many people who are buzzed, including myself, often feel angry.  I say often, but I don't actually get angry every single time, but I do get angry often enough.

One thing that made me feel better about this was the scientific finding that people don't like it when their space "bubble" is invaded upon because they sense a threat. Of course, there's the exception from my friend, Liam, who claims that there's a country where there is zero body space even between women and men in casual conversation. Of course, this needs to be verified by appropriate "research". :)

Just kidding, I do think that this feeling is universal in humans.

Also, universal is the notion that someone threatening one's life pisses them off royally.

Hence, getting angry when one gets buzzed is normal, and I think it's healthy, too.

On the other hand, one can get really tired of being angry all the time. There is a way out!

I use several techniques in order to reduce the amount of mental energy that I waste getting angry with motorists.

There are just too many wonderful things in the world to think about, and too many things to do to be angry all the time. Also, I have the notion of transferring emotional energy. That is, one can often pick up on the emotional energy of other people. Buzzing is a way a motorist tranfers their anger to cyclists. But, to a point, a cyclist can decline the energy transfer offer. Also, I noticed those who claim to be the most rational and the most unfeeling are often actually the most emotional and subject to emotional swings.

To keep one's emotions one's own, the first thing I learned was that if you wait till you get buzzed, it's too late.

One way to avoid bad vibes is not to notice each vehicles passing distance. If they are passing really close, you'll know. If they are going to hit you, you can't avoid it. It's not possible. If they don't hit you then they did you no physical harm so you should be grateful to be alive.

So there's little to be gained by judging the motorists.

Next, while riding, I often adopt a neutral facial expression. Also, while meditating as per previous posts, I find that when I get buzzed, it's not so bad.

I find that much of the mental pain of getting buzzed is due to mental grasping to one's body and this world. Realizing that one is going to die one day helps. Also, realizing that dying while cycling is the best way to die is helpful, too. 

Also, I beam a silent wish of good will to each motorist. A simple "Be happy" for each vehicle that passes me no matter how near or far they come.

If someone does pass you, it's best to know that the thing that the motorists is looking for is some kind of reaction from you. While it's not possible to stop our normal emotional processes and displays especially when one first starts, just thinking about what the motorist wants helps me calm down.

I highly, highly recommend against confronting the driver. It usually leads to no good.

If the motorist is breaking the law, feel free to call it in. There are some verified mental drivers out there, and we need to create a legal track record of who they are especially their vehicles and plate numbers. I hope that they reform themselves on their own, but that's not likely.

Personally, I tend to like the idea of forgiveness. As one Amish family said to the perpetrator when one of their own was mowed down by a motorist, "God has brought our families together for a reason."

I'm not Amish, and I can't bring myself to believe that it all happens for a good reason, but I try.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Persecutated Complexion</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I really, really don't like to play the victim nor to complain at all.

I do think that the word "persecution" is totally over-used, but if you start to see a pattern where anything that's legal but when a bicycle is added magically becomes illegal. Also, it's persecution when the police start targeting a certain group by actually making up laws then giving out warnings and tickets for them.

One example, is listening to music. It's known the distractions are distractions, but because cell phones are new, we focus on them instead of realizing that normal conversations of drivers with passengers or listening to the radio can be just as distracting to a motorist.

Motorists have another problem which is reduced hearing. One thing that makes cycling so safe is that we can hear much better than a motorist. Add headphones, and we are about the same as a motorist with his radio off and no conversations, cell or otherwise. But wearing headphones is illegal, but car radios are not. 

Why?

It has zero to do with safety, it's because banning car radios is politically not feasible while targeting cyclists for headphones is. All of a sudden public officials have become experts in traffic safety.

Which is kind of funny because the vast majority of accidents, there is nothing being done. It's almost a constant that speed kills, and wide roads with few stops promotes speed and these things are continuing to be made. People continue to brag about speeding which kills more people than drunk driving. Imagine people publicly stated how "shit faced" they are all the time and they drive drunk. 

So instead of the crackdown on people who kill, there's the continual focus on things that don't matter, but somehow bother a small section of our society who are clearly mentally ill and ought not be denied the medical help they need. 

<a href="http://gawker.com/5811174/skirted-cycling-the-latest-in-nyc-biking-crime">Here's and example.</a>

A ticket was given for wearing a skirt while cycling because it was "distracting" to motorists.

Obviously by this logic all billboards should be banned. Also, all pedestrians should also be put to this same standard which means instituting head to toe covering for women as their beautiful faces can also be distracting.

I'd argue that any motorist who lacks to emotional maturity to keep his shit together and to realize that his and other's safety is more important than a tiny bit of visual stimulus from a women that he's never going to meet anyway, should lose his license.

But if we did that then we wouldn't have a double standard anymore.

Finally, I'd like to note that the entire city of Copenhagen dresses exactly like this woman did. In fact, she wasn't really that racy at all. 

For men who completely lose control over their entire body when there's a beautiful woman around here's some advice:

1. Don't look. Do the guy test. If she were a guy would you stare? Would you say things to a guy? If not, don't do it.

2. Realize that she's not interested in you and won't have sex with you. So whatever you do will be as effective and frustrating as banging your head on the wall. Also, note that if you really are interested, whatever you do, from your car, is probably going to further turn her off. So if you are a dreamer, and hope for a chance with her later, don't do anything.

If you have trouble with #1 and #2 read on. Otherwise, you are cured.

3. Internet porn. Until you are sore. Wash rinse and repeat. Every man has his limits. Find yours. At home. Alone. Don't bother the ladies.

4. Get a girlfriend. Seriously. This is a whole other thread, but if you are still hard up, you need one badly.

5. Meditation. If all the above failed, this probably will, too, but I thought you should give it a try. You seriously need to train your mind in order that you are not a slave to it anymore. Meditation can do this, but you have to want help.

6. Counseling. You need a licensed professional. I used to joke that sex addiction doesn't exist, but it does. Get help before you go to jail.

7. Chemical castration. Hey, this is controversial, but I think that this is a last ditch effort at civilization.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Back when I could stomach it, I was calling local reps on the phone in order to see their positions on cycling in order to see if I should support their re-election.

In every call, I asked them if they supported government's involvement in cycling commuting. She was totally stunned so I had to ask her how she got to work. She had no idea what I was talking about.

I finally got her to admit that in fact she drove a car to work. Then I explained that cycling commuting was the same thing but with a bicycle instead of a car.

She had "too many meetings" so bicycling was "unrealistic for her." I thought was strange because my call was about the government making cycling commuting feasible for the whole. I guess she thought I called her, a stranger, specifically to harass her to cycle. I guess for some people it's all about them. :)

This got me thinking about how much more stuff I would get done if I had a bicycle.

I bet I'd be so more productive going to more stores, buying more things, and getting more exercise.

I usually don't like to do this because I am trying to cut down on talking about my boring life just like a smoker tries to cut down on ciggies.

Here's my weekend:

Friday: Right from work ride to bike shop. This is a cheat b/c I got a ride, but I did bring my bicycle.

Get bike fixed at show which is reason I got a ride.

Meet my wife and eat from Gastro-truck which was the best burger I ever had. Thanks, princess.

Walk to friend's house.

Walk to grocery store buy stuff.

Walk back to friend's house where we prepare dinner.

Eat and sleep at their place.

Saturday:

Get up and go to restaurant with my love.

Ride home and sleep. Get a call from friend.

Go ride to naked ride. Miss it.

Wonderful ride along harbor.

Beach and surfing.

Ride home.

Hang out with wife.

Sunday:

Get up and to to restuarant. Go to coffee shop and write.

Ride to Lips where we see cool drag show at friend's birthday.

Ride home and nap.

Ride to pool. Swim. Drink with friend in her hotel room while we watch basketball on tv and listen to rap.

Ride to another friend's group home.

Meet two people there who go on a short bike ride with me.

Show up at Dave's, the beer dude's, house. Bottle beer while sampling some strange ales like a stout with cherry and chocolate. Also, had a sorghum beer among other things.

Talk to Dave and his GF about poetry and beer.

Ride home and hang with wife. 

Sweet dreams.

Yeah, if I had a car, I'd probably do double the things including going on more bike rides. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>The Mouse That Roared</title>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[One theme I see over and over again now that our entire civilization needs to bow down to the nebulous safety god, is that we are often afraid of things that are not likely to harm us. Conversely, we do not fear things that are an actual threat.

A great example is the obsession with designing every single street in the country around fire trucks.

"Of course," shouts the fire chief, "you don't want to be burned in a fire, do you?"

That's really difficult to argue with. The problem is that it's a rhetorical trick. See how powerful the fire chief is because he claims to have the sole key to saving our children's lives.

The problem is that this is highly misleading.

According to the CDC, last year, 2,565 people (not including firefighters) died in fires. I believe that the number of firefighters for all of US for an entire year was 85. 

Thus dying in a fire in the United States is a minor risk.*

So what? These are still a whole two and half thousands of people who's deaths could have been prevented by a more rapid response. The problem is that we all ready have done everything that the fire chiefs wanted. As one article stated, fire chiefs plan communities, see above where they have that killer statement. I have heard even a fire chief, in uniform, during a public planning meeting, giving anecdotes about burning children if a road were made a little bit slower. Sigh.

Part of the problem is that fire trucks are big because fire men like big toys. There are and have been smaller fire truck technology for over a hundred years. So getting smaller trucks would be safer, too, especially if there's an accident on the freeway, and they need to get by. 

Secondly, the plan isn't for one fire truck to get through, but for two. I feel that this is often over kill and can be solved in other ways.

How?

Well, for all the wide lanes that fire people ask for, why are the city blocks so long? If the blocks were shorter, then they would be more accessible which would also cut down on response times. My answer is that people like to drive fast, and when there's an option between driving fast and saving lives in a fire, those burning kids in the above anecdote take a back seat.

Second, why are there cul-de-sacs when these are known to be deadly in terms of response times? Answer is that people feel "safe" in a cul-de-sac so again their feelings trump the above.

Third, why don't we have dedicated lanes just for emergency vehicles like in Korea? See number one. People like lanes to drive their cars burning kids be damned.

So the point is that in our current climate, we have talked a lot about fire safety, but we made things less safe.

My proposal is to address all three of the above and more.

For one, I feel that a comprehensive network of bike lanes that was also a fire lane would really work out in terms of response times. It would also fulfill the complete streets act, reduce carbon emissions, get cyclists off the street and sidewalks, create more parking, and reduce pedestrian, cyclist, and motorist deaths. 

Why don't we do this?

I have no idea because it's a brilliant idea.

At any rate, the next time a fire chief comes with his smoke and fire story about how you'll fry children if you put in a bicycle lane, ask him how many people a year die in fires. Then how many pedestrians are run down and killed by cars. Finally, the number who die in motor vehicle accidents. Also, what's the leading cause of deaths in motor vehicle accidents.

Pretty soon, you'll see that for each burning child you have ten kids who now pancakes inside their parent's once shiny SUVs. 

Thus, the giant lion that roared so big turns out to be just a tiny mouse.*

* Standard disclaimer:  I'll put it down here because we need this a lot: We don't agree with any person dying. If we can save one life it will all be worth it.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Bicycle With Dignity</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/06/16/bicycle-with-dignity/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This is partially inspired by a good friend of mine who thinks that bicycling is not "dignified".

Now I do feel that cycling is as another friend puts it, "a humble form of transportation", and I love it for that.

But to cycle does not mean to lack dignity.

For one thing, I am learning about dog training, and one thing is that the pack leader is the calmest and moves the slowest.

In fact, there's something to be said about not needing to speed around all the time. There were two examples that further bolster this point.

The first is the road that I work on which is super high speed despite the fact that it's the only game in town for hundreds of workers who work in buildings along it. Thus, though it is on the average a minute or two faster to drive to work each day, it's several orders of magnitude more dangerous, louder, and more annoying for the rest of other 478 minutes in a work day.

Each day, I see cars waiting and waiting for the road to clear then speeding across the four lanes, praying for dear life. Everyday.

What a way to live.

I am a huge fan of living one's life to the fullest, neglecting safety, and taking risks, but I think that in this case, the risk is pointless. For one thing, it's not a risk that anyone has a choice about. Secondly, people don't really realize how dangerous it is. This is the one place where people die a great deal, but there are no warning signs and no worry of liability for making things so deadly.

The second example is where I was cross a street, in the cross walk, on foot at the start of the light at a pretty fast pace that I walk, and an officer yelled at me to "hurry up". 

What he meant is that as someone momentarily outside of a car, I was a lower class person and should thus scurry out of the way of the motorists who would in turn get out of their vehicles and also become of my caste. I guess this is why people insist on driving across the street. :)

In both cases, I feel that it is more dignified to not have to rush across the street like a scared animal. Rushing around, even inside a car, to me is unseemly.

Shouldn't we have the fundamental human right to travel as slow as we want?

Of course, this seems absurd until you note that there's a whole organization, MADD, who wants to eliminate drunk driving. While I feel that saving lives in this manner, more people die through speeding than through drunk driving. Shouldn't we focus on the bigger issue, too? Thus there should be a MASD: Mothers Against Speeding Drivers, who would save just as many lives if not more.

Thus, I feel that riding a bicycle can be done with perfect dignity.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Critical Hockey</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Last night, I was talking to a friend about critical mass, that lovely monthly group ride, and about how the better the infrastructure of a city, the smaller the mass, and the whole pointlessness of it.

The pinnacle of this example, is of course, Copenhagen where they have no official critical mass, but in another respect, their much narrower streets manager to accommodate the amount of bicycles on every street that are only in one small area of San Diego.

This reminds me of the Nike commercials where they show other sports are criminalized.  For example, tennis players had to hide their rackets when the police came around which just goes to demonstrate that the perception of crime, in sports, is caused by the class of people associated with the sport rather than the sport's inherent danger to society such as this
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTggndhdAA">Nike Ad.</a>

Meanwhile, how many people think we should ban the true dangers to society like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q5V6DKH3bw">hockey</a> who's fans cause many more traffic jams than critical mass (each game) and even cause millions of dollars in damage in riots?

So whenever we talk about banning bicycles or critical mass, we should first ban all the other sports which cause more damage.

Now, I'm actually not proposing banning anything, just having a proportional response. I also wonder how awesome it would be to bicycle if we spent the same money for a stadium, the millions of dollars in road additions and improvements to get people to the games, and the excessive amount of money given to law enforcement for each game. We'd be living in a Copenhagen, and there would be no more critical mass. Also, there would be fewer auto accidents and less traffic for motorists.

This brings me to a really brilliant and bizarre rhetorical anti-cycling trick. When backed into a corner, someone who religiously supports motoring at all times even to an absurd point, will call any plans for bicycle improvements "utopian". 

In this regard, they have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_the_well">poisoned the well.</a> Now the cyclist is totally discredited because all the benefits are seen as impossibly unrealistic like a utopia.

Well, I do live in a utopia now--thanks, princess--and I see tomorrow as being even better.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Below is a boilerplate email I got regarding this law. It's important enough to repost unmodified. I'll post my insightful comments in the future.

BEGIN BOILERPLATE POST

    I'm writing to ask for your help on behalf of our 3-foot passing legislation.

    Senate Bill 910, cosponsored by the California Bicycle Coalition and the City of Los Angeles, would require motorists to give bicyclists at least three feet of clearance when passing from behind under most circumstances.  

     

    The California Senate approved SB 910 on June 1. On Monday, June 27, the bill will be up for a vote by the Assembly Transportation Committee. We need bicyclists like you to contact Assemblymember Bonnie Lowenthal, the chair of the committee, by phone, email or fax to let her know why this bill is so important to the safety of all bicyclists on the road! 

    A file documenting all messages of support for SB 910 accompanies the bill as it moves through the legislative process. This information is read by legislators and their staff and helps make the case for the bill. Your voice definitely counts! The deadline for calling or sending a message is 5 PM Tuesday, June 21.

     

    You can express your support for SB 910 by phone or by email or fax:

     

    By phone

     

    Call the Assembly Transportation Committee office at (916) 319-2093 with this message:

     

    "My name is _________ and I'm from _________ and I'm calling to express my support for Senate Bill 910, which will be heard by the committee on June 27. SB 910 would help create safer road conditions for bicyclists in our area and help prevent the leading cause of bicyclist fatalities in California."   

     

    Please make this call by 5 PM next Tuesday. 

     

    By email or fax

     

    Copy and paste the sample letter below into an email message or onto your own letterhead, add your name and location, and email it to Assemblymember.Lowenthal@assembly.ca.gov or fax it to (916) 319-2154 by 5 PM next Tuesday. Please also send a copy to the SB 910 author, Sen. Alan Lowenthal (no relation to Bonnie), at Senator.Lowenthal@senate.ca.gov or (916) 327-9113.

     

    IMPORTANT! If you or a family member have been involved in a collision or fall in California because a motor vehicle passed too close, briefly summarize the facts in your letter. The information is essential for showing why this law is needed.

     

    I hope we can count on your support. Please contact Communications Director Jim Brown at jimbrown@calbike.org or (916) 446-7558 if you have questions or need more information.  
     

    Thanks!

    ______________________________________________________________________________________________ 

     

    SAMPLE SUPPORT LETTER 

     

    June 16, 2011

     

    Hon. Bonnie Lowenthal

    Chair, Assembly Transportation Committee

    State Capitol, Room 3152

    Sacramento, CA 95814 

    Fax:  916-319-2154

     

    Re: SB 910 (Lowenthal) - SUPPORT

     

    Dear Assemblymember Lowenthal,

     

    I'm a bicyclist and I'm writing to express my support for Senate Bill 910, which will be heard by the Assembly Transportation Committee on June 27.

     

    Bicyclists too often face dangerous conditions on California's streets and roads due to motorists passing too closely. When this happens, the slightest error by the motorist or the most minor shift by the bicyclist to avoid trash, broken glass or rough pavement can lead to a collision. This type of collision is the leading cause of adult bicyclist fatalities in California and the U.S.

     

    By requiring motorists to give bicyclists at least 3 feet of space when passing, SB 910 can help prevent deadly collisions and make more people feel comfortable about choosing to ride their bikes. The bill modifies existing state law that requires a motorist to maintain an unspecified "safe distance" when passing a bicyclist. The California Driver's Handbook already recommends three feet of clearance when motorists pass bicyclists. Eighteen other states have enacted similar laws.

     

    A specified passing distance provides a more objective and easily understood definition for "safe passing" and gives law enforcement and the courts a more objective basis for enforcing California's safe passing requirement. Most importantly, it expresses a motorist's special responsibility to share the road safely with more vulnerable road users like bicyclists.

     

    I hope I can count on your support for SB 910.

     

    Sincerely,

     

    &lt;&gt;

    &lt;&gt; 

     

    CC: Sen. Alan Lowenthal

    ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

     

    WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT TO WIN
     

    Winning passage of SB 910 requires the support of everyone who cares about safer road conditions for bicyclists, including support for the staff resources needed to promote this bill before the Legislature.

    Please consider making an online donation today to help us get this bill enacted.

  <title>Anti-buzz Law Elaborated</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/06/21/anti-buzz-law-elaborated/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Not so surprisingly, there is actually opposition to the law that would make buzzing illegal.

That's right, there are assholes out there who think that the law should chime in on harassing cyclists and to say that it's OK.

Yes, I try to be positive, but if you harass someone smaller or weaker than you then you are an asshole and a bully. I still love, you, but hey, you suck. :)

Here are some organizations who oppose the three foot passing law:

Number one is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidkun_Quisling">Quisling</a> organization of CABO (California Association of Bicycling Organizations):

Here's what they claim to want:

"...bicyclists are hemmed in by imprecise special laws that confuse motorists, police, courts, and bicyclists themselves as to their rights, responsibilities, and proper behavior. These inconsistencies pose a formidable obstacle to the encouragement and expansion of a socially advantageous mode of transportation. Nonetheless, bicycle issues have rarely been directly addressed in case law and have received meager attention in the legal literature."

From their <a href="http://www.cabobike.org/articles/bicycles-and-the-law/">legal page</a> just in case you think I'm taking them out of context.

This is the same Benedict Arnold that opposed research on bicycle boxes. Definitely a bunch of motorists first masquerading as cycle advocates.

Secondly is the quasi-government organization of the AAA. I say quasi-government because the government shares your private information with them. That is, if you get a license, don't be surprised if you get junk mail from the AAA. I'm really not a lawyer, but I don't think that any old organization can get a direct feed into a government database.

If someone knows more, please enlighten me. I'm super-curious on how they got my information. Not that I really care, too much about privacy, but I am a bit creeped out because I feel that this is unfair to other organizations who want to data mine the DMV. Imagine what we'd find!

'AAA - The Automobile Club of Southern California and AAA Northern California oppose SB910, claiming the proposed law “replaces reasonableness and judgment with a fixed and arbitrary ‘safe distance’.” '

Which is so silly because I wonder how buzzing someone is reasonable and a safe judgment. In fact, I think that three feet is minimum. 

Three feet is a small child. If you can imagine a small and very athletic child holding on to your handle bars and extending her little legs into traffic, if the bottom of their foot bumps the side mirror of the car, that's three feet. For a huge truck, that's really scary.

The problem is that there is no way to enforce this now which is why the law is created. I'm sure if there is an extreme imaginary case why someone really, really needs to buzz a cyclist, a court can take that into account.

'AAA especially dislikes the 15 MPH passing provision, saying, “Drivers currently are not required to estimate the speed of other moving objects around them, and to precisely calculate their speed in relation to that moving object.” '

If these people were around when we discovered fire, we'd still be eating raw meat. No, we wouldn't. We'd still be in trees because coming out of trees, hunting, and using fire to cook were not "currently around" when we first started to do them. :)

I am not a fan of the "broken window" theory, but in this case, tracking down drivers who drive erratically, including buzzing people can prevent other crimes:

"On 06/11/11 at 0127 hours Officer Jillard and Officer Cummings stopped a white Dodge Ram truck for driving erratically.  When the officers tried to conduct standardized field sobriety tests the driver advised
the officers he had a loaded .45 caliber pistol in the car.  The pistol and two canisters of bear repellent, yes, bear repellent were recovered from the truck.  The driver was arrested for concealed carry of a loaded pistol and was given accommodations at San Diego County Jail."

In San Diego, you can report erratic drivers, including those who buzz you (just say they are driving erratically, there are children in a car somewhere, and NEVER say you are riding a bicycle because they won't come then).

  <title>Deschooling Advocacy</title>

I'm reading a brilliant, though long-winded and too angry, book called _Deschooling Society_ by Ivan Illich.

Many of the lessons from the book can be applied to bicycle advocacy.

For example:

"People who submit to the standard of others for the measure of their personal growth soon apply the rule to themselves...People who have been schooled down to size let unmeasured experience slip through their hands."

Isn't this exactly what is happening in advocacy? Many advocates obsess over numbers: crash statistics, this study and that study. They'll study an issue to death instead of just implementing it.

I, on the other hand, agree with my friends who's thesis suggests that a good road invites its users to bicycle. When they do, it's a good experience.

Thus the only way of measuring a good road is to ride one's bicycle on it.

But the schooled advocate has lost all trust of his own experience and judgement. He won't invite others to ride with him because he's too caught up in charts and graphs and tables and academic papers.

When there's a lack of numbers on the subject, he'll just say "no" instead of growing some and taking a risk.

Old age used to mean something because older people had more experience, but with the schooled advocate, it's the opposite. They have no experience because instead of cycling and seeing what it's like to ride on different infrastructure, he's too busy driving to meeting where they endlessly pontificate on numbers and vehicle codes.

And when there's no data to back up his point of view, he'll make it up.

In fact, when you do mention experience;

"To them, what cannot be measured becomes secondary, theatening."

Also, they are closed to new ideas:

"They do not have to be robbed of their creativity. Under instruction, they have unlearned to do their thing or to be themselves, and they value only what has been made or could be made [under current law]."

Ivan's book has many more insights which apply to bicycle advocacy and how the school minded mentality shackles one's intellect and makes intelligent decisions impossible.

Perhaps this is why there's such a disconnect between the claims made on how San Diego's roads, and how it feels to ride on them.

It certainly explains why people can feel that we "waste so much money on cycling" and yet the cyclists feel like they have the smelly end of the tail pipe.

I leave you with the seven steps to Southern California Cycling Infrastructure Mastery

1. Forget what you know.

2. Go outside.

3. Get on a bicycle.

4. NO! Do NOT strap a bicycle to your car--get on a bicycle where you are.

5. Ride (but not too fast).

6. Experience.

7. Now you're an expert on cycling infrastructure.]]></content:encoded>

I feel that I've been overly negative lately which goes against the entire stated purpose of this blog.

Also, I feel that while selfishness is great; we have to think about other people, too. Well, we don't have to, but I do think that it can be healthy.

Therefore, while I love the ghost bike notion as well as the "Ride of Silence", I feel that cyclists shouldn't just be focused on their own world all the time.

Thus, I propose a new holiday which will help mourn, but also celebrate the lives of those motorists who's lives have been cut short by motoring.

The idea is fuzzy at this point, but it's a combination of Day of the Dead as well as the Ride of Silence, but it's only for motorists who died while motoring.

Part of my inspiration is <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/LIVING/06/22/forgiving.yourself/">this</a>.

I think that too often, the easy way out is to demonize the motorist, but I feel that they are people, too. I just wouldn't want my sister to marry one. :)

I guess the point is that we are all motorists, and I'd like a day where we (cyclists and motorists) set aside our differences for one day.

If we do this, perhaps motorists can see us more as obstacles who want to take away their parking and create a draconian world where everyone has clean air to breath and there's no obesity.

As part of the celebration I can see us riding our bicycles to the roadside memorials, leaving a single rose. Perhaps sweeping up or otherwise rehabilitating the road side markers.

Also, I feel we should have a prayer service for the deceased. I know that in our PC world, nobody will be able to agree on a standard prayer, but I feel that we should pray in the language of the victims.

While it is important for insurance agents and the like to determine why the person died, and who is at fault, on this one day, we won't blame anyone.

Even if someone does something as insane and unthinkable like taking over a bike lane with no concern to cyclists then driving double the speed limit while in the bike lane, I don't think we should judge.

For just one day.

To quote the good man R. King: "Why can't we all just get along?"]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Lately I have been watching Californication which I consider to be the best TV show ever because the male lead is not an asshole nor is he total pushover.

I do NOT consider him to be a role model in any way, but it is refreshing to see a male on TV who's decisions I can relate to, someone who acts in a normal, sensible manner.

Perhaps since I was sick and watching so much TV, I have begun to feel that my life is more like a television show. Not because of what I do--I'll always be a quiet, well mannered, nice guy--but because how I parse my experiences.

Last night, I saw the Uganda children's choir which made me feel like I was at one of Portia's charity events. Last weekend, in between being sick, I took a bicycle ride to find a nice cafe to write in.

These days I don't write fiction anymore because I realized that, for me, it has a very low intrinsic reward. I started writing fiction to better deal with my own emotions.

These days, things are going well, so there's no emotions to deal with. Well, there weren't, but isn't life a wonderful roller coaster of pain?

Anyway, with my muse back, I wanted to find a place to write.

During my ride, I rode down a street called Nile which I love. Other than being an amazing river in Africa which I long to see, someday, the Nile is the title of an early Pink Floyd song which is so rocking, it's actually early metal.

Every time I ride down this street, I hear this song in my head. On the other hand, I always fear that since I don't know the street, if I stay on it for too long, I'll wind up at a dead end (NOT a cul-de-sac since few San Diegan streets have the canonical sac which makes a dead end a cul-de-sac). :)

This time there was no fear because I was joy cycling.

Guess what I found? Yes, a dead end, which actually was, in this case, a real, live cul-de-sac.

The park was empty save for the single family there (not the obligatory SUV). It was a dad playing with his children, which I love to see.

[caption id="attachment_521" align="alignleft" width="300" caption="Actual cul-de-sac Nile Park"]<a href="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/cimg2455.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-521" title="cimg2455" src="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/cimg2455.jpg?w=300" alt="Nile Park" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]

After I climbed that hill, I went searching for more dead ends.

Here's a big drop off. I can't recall where. Note there's no point in riding down here unless you want to ride back up!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Of course, I did waste my time riding down the big hill as it reminded me for some reason of Cuerna Vaca, MX:

&nbsp;

[caption id="attachment_522" align="alignright" width="300" caption="Pointless dropoff which looks like Cuera Vaca"]<a href="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/cimg2458.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-522" title="Pointless-dropoff-street" src="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/cimg2458.jpg?w=300" alt="Pointless dropoff which looks like Cuera Vaca" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Finally, I followed Juniper heading West. Again, I thought it was a pointless dead end that I'd have to climb back out of:

&nbsp;

[caption id="attachment_523" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="Juniper Canyon West Bound"]<a href="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/cimg2460.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-523" title="Juniper-West" src="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/cimg2460.jpg?w=300" alt="Juniper Canyon West Bound" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]

&nbsp;

But I was wrong. I was kind of happy to have found a new, but pointless because of the huge hill, way to get from City Heights to South Park:

[caption id="attachment_524" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="Juniper Canyon East Bound"]<a href="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/cimg2462.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-524" title="Juniper-East" src="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/cimg2462.jpg?w=300" alt="Juniper Canyon East Bound" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]

This is the other side looking back. I was so happy to see so much green and so many canyons.

&nbsp;

Overall, it's been a great, but surreal week. I'm going to spend more time trying to appreciate what I have. I'd like to break the annoying habit of fault finding that I often have. It's fun to complain, but usually it's a waste of time.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Tiny Fire Trucks</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don't know why, but I have always had an aversion to the whole size issue especially the idea that, "bigger is better."</p>
<p>I guess it's because I acknowledge that sometimes it's true, sometimes, it's not. It all depends.</p>
<p>When it comes to rescue equipment, I feel that this notion is a false one.</p>
<p>Long time readers know that my nefarious, hidden agenda is to create safer, quieter streets with cleaner air.</p>
<p>One of the biggest obstacles to this has been fire codes which are based upon equipment which seems more to feed the egos of the departments than to actually be necessary.</p>
<p>OBLIGATORY STANDARD DISCLAIMER: I have nothing against firefighters in principle. Some of my friends have been firefighters. Also, I have a great deal of respect for what they do. They save a lot of lives each year in the US, and I think that they should be proud of the work that they do.</p>
<p>But like, my doctor friends, I have found that the biggest critics of the field are actually practitioners. Thus, I'm sure there's a lot of firefighters who'd actually agree with everything I say here. In short, this isn't personal.</p>
<p>(I hate writing disclaimers, but later on, I'm glad they are there).</p>
<p>That being, said, let's get on with it.</p>
<p>First of all, contrary to popular belief, fire is not that deadly in the US. I know that some people will never grasp this, but according to the CDC, only about 3,000 a year die in fires. Even firefighting doesn't kill that many people as only 85 firefighters die per year.</p>
<p>http://www.cdc.gov/HomeandRecreationalSafety/Fire-Prevention/fires-factsheet.html</p>
<p>While every life lost is a tragedy, it only makes sense to put our money and effort into areas where the most people can be saved.</p>
<p>I do think we should continue to fund our brave firefighters, perhaps increase their budgets, but while doing this, we can't let our primal fear of fire blind us to greater risks.</p>
<p>Also, we must ask ourselves whether such a small number of deaths should cause us to completely lose our minds and totally redesign the way that millions of us live.</p>
<p>I'm not advocating for less safety, but with fire fighting consuming so much money, the fact is, 3000 people are still dying. At this point, it doesn't seem like more money is the solution. We can't save everyone. It's sad, but the sooner we face this fact, the quicker we can start to make adult decisions.</p>
<p>The only way we're going to save more people it to completely ban smoking and cooking as they account for most deaths. To go a bit further, we can do without electricity to eliminate electrical fires.</p>
<p>Seeing as a society, we can't even get people to stop being proud of speeding, which kills more kids than drunk driving, we're hard pressed to force people to eat raw meat and do without a good smoke once in a while.</p>
<p>I think it's OK because I like a little risk, a little randomness in my life. I have to die of something, and I'm OK to die after someone had a decent meal or a good smoke.</p>
<p>What I'm really getting at is, if wide streets make people speed which kills people, and the streets have to be wide for fire trucks to fight fires where almost nobody dies of, we are we totally unconcerned about the 16 people who die in collisions for every fire victim?</p>
<p>Because they have bulky equipment which needs to be on bulky trucks. Right?<br />
Fire Chief Paul Dextras said the city will benefit from using the QRVs because they are smaller and safer than regular firetrucks and they will save the city money over time.<br />
I'm not so sure. We've been fighting fires for a long time. Plus, we are supposedly really intelligent and technical. It only makes sense that we could find a solution that could still save the same number of lives, cut costs, and reduce traffic collisions.</p>
<p>This might sound utopian, but I ask, if we can't at least try to make the world a better place, why are we even here?</p>
<p>I propose that the city buy smaller fire trucks. I know that this will be seen as a bad idea by many especially firefighters, the good guys.</p>
<p>Billings, Montana tried to buy smaller trucks, and the Fire Chief agreed:</p>
<p>"Fire Chief Paul Dextras said the city will benefit from using the QRVs because they are smaller and safer than regular firetrucks and they will save the city money over time."</p>
<p>Read more: http://billingsgazette.com/news/local/government-and-politics/article_e9bb1a9a-46b0-11df-b8a9-001cc4c002e0.html#ixzz1QJ6pOIVg</p>
<p>That's right, the Fire Chief said that smaller trucks were SAFER.</p>
<p>Then I looked to see how I could get my hands on one of these babies:</p>
<p>http://www.alibaba.com/product-free/118268508/Narrow_Field_Fire_Truck_Small_Fire.html</p>
<p>These trucks are actually pretty sexy.</p>
<p>Thus, the first step, towards truly livable streets, is to get the city to purchase smaller fire and rescue equipment. Only then can we change the childish laws that make every road, no matter how minor, completely out of proportion to the actual human beings who walk along it.</p>
<p>Narrower streets encourage people to get more exercise which helps with obesity.</p>
<p>People are happier when they have slower traffic, and they have less stress. Commute times will NOT increase; they might even go down.</p>
<p>Peace will reign on earth for a thousand years and a thousand flowers will bloom.</p>

  <title>Virtual Parking Spaces</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_536" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="Commercial Trucks Taking Advantage of &quot;Free Parking&quot;"]<a href="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/cimg2436.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-536" title="parallel-parked-trucks" src="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/cimg2436.jpg?w=300" alt="Commercial Trucks Taking Advantage of &quot;Free Parking&quot;" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]

One of the biggest problems with getting more bicycle lanes is the old, tired argument that it will eliminate parking spaces.

I don't think that this is actually true if, and IF is a huge word, the bicycle paths are implemented properly.

The problem with parking spaces is that it's the same problem with any good that is free--scarcity will occur. Thus, there's no purpose to create more parking because like any other good which is physical, it will be used and abused.

An example is the parking spaces which were sucked up by trucks which have been parked there for weeks. When the city designed free parking, they didn't think that people would park their trucks there indefinitely, but without some kind of enforcement--which would make the parking less free--there's no way to solve this problem of shortages.

Also, there's a limit to the distance that people are willing to walk which is why the zoo claims it needs more parking while at the same time, they have several football fields worth of ugly asphalt which is ALWAYS EMPTY. ALWAYS.

The only way to fill it would be have people camp there which would turn the zoo into a trailer park.

Thus, we have something that is abundant and scarce at the same time.

If this were a gadget commercial, at this point, the voice over would say, "There has to be a better way."

There is.

If the businesses encouraged biking, they'd get free parking spaces. In fact, there are infinite possible parking spaces available. That is, if everyone biked to the store, it would be possible to have a healthy business, and at the same time to have an open parking lot.

For example, long term readers know that I bike everywhere. I go to at least ten different places each week. Thus, each week, at a given time, I am creating 10 parking spaces as is my princess. Plus, we don't have a car at home which creates more "open space".

This stuff adds up quick. Next time you drive somewhere and find that there's one more good parking spot left, but there's a bike chained up out front, you see that CYCLISTS GIVE MOTORISTS FREE PARKING ALL THE TIME.

I'm not saying that they owe us anything or need to be nice to us on the road. It's just that if I got such a benefit, I'd try to be grateful to the person instead of coming up with repetitive, shitty jokes like, "I could have killed you back there."

Kill me! You should be kissing my ass! :)

Why they can't see such obvious benefits is probably due to a depressive point of view called crystal ball.

Using their crystal ball, they'd say, "People don't bike in Southern California so it's pointless to make infrastructure for them."

Which is also circular reasoning. Two logical fallacies in one!

Think about it. If you eliminate three street spots and four people bike to your store, your up one parking space.

If people are NOT biking, the problem is crappy infrastructure.

This can be discovered by reading countless papers, scientific and otherwise. There's tons of data to support this.

Or you could talk to people who will say the same thing.]]></content:encoded>

&nbsp;

One of the stranger objections to commuting cycling that I have gotten, from a big bad-ass Navy man no less, was that he felt that he couldn't "get away" fast on a bicycle.

To me, that made no sense because I feel that it's actually much easier to escape a bad situation on a bicycle than a car.

Sure bicycles are slower, but unless you are on a straight away on a highway like Fairmount with a sheer wall on the side, it's actually easier to get away.

You can salmon, you can hit the sidewalk, allies, right on read into traffic. I'm not saying that I do these things regularly (that's another post, haha), but they are all available on a bicycle.

How many times have we gotten buzzed only to catch up to the a-hole (may they be happy) when they get stuck at a light.

How else do you think that I give out my charity dollars to these bullies?

Thus, I see bicycling as a way of feeling like one has no control. With the obsession of the "vulnerable cyclist" and the "helmet mass hysteria", we see that the act of cycling, especially in a bike-hostile city like San Diego makes cyclists out to be victims in waiting.

From my perception, however, nothing can be further from the truth.

Still, it's interesting to see how victim mentality is related to cycling to understand the fearful's points of view.

I'm reading a chapter on victims in the wonderful book called _Imperfect Control_ by Judith Viorst.

Here's a good passage:

"From along with the damaged self-regard that victimization bring, there are changes in how the victim is treated by others, treatment that can make him feel weak and pathetic and undeserving and basically flawed, treatment that can include contempt and rejection and sometimes outright hostility."

This passage really rang true to me especially with regards to how motorists and the media treat cyclists who are attacked by motorists.

As Forrester said regarding cycling inferiority syndrome, there's the notion that cyclists should be on the road, and whatever happens to them they just "get what's coming to them."

This is funny because with this attitude, some advocates still wonder why people don't wish to cycle.

If I had a victim mentality regarding cycling, I wouldn't want to do it either, and I'd see anyone who did cycle as a lunatic.

Thus, we should be careful of complaining. It's usually bad to complain in mixed company ever, but it's especially bad for cyclists to complain to motorists, who feel that they are being blamed for things that are "out of their control".

Also, complaining too much of the dangers that our current system creates will perpetuate the victim mentality that many have towards cyclists. It will also get people to seek out superstitious solutions and magic panaceas such as helmet laws.

Instead of supporting sensible laws like the three foot passing law, the response will be more along the lines of you shouldn't have worn that dress.

Thus, I feel that cyclists should see themselves as not just as cyclists, but as being, actually very powerful especially in places like San Diego.

It's not easy to go against "common sense" and the well meaning admonitions of basically everyone who hasn't cycled since their age broke double digits.

Thus, as cyclists, we rise against our circumstances. We're not victims because if we felt like victims, we could just drive. Motoring is still in our power.

In fact, the government does everything except for pay for our private cars.

BEGIN STRANGE SIDEBAR

Incidentally, I wonder why we don't get government cars. The utility of cars is in the network of fuel stations and highways which is the largest part of the cost of motoring. Without this tax payer welfare system, even the most expensive Ashton would be relatively worthless compared to a Target mountain bike.

Yet buying people cars is socialist, while paying for highways is not.

END STRANGE SIDEBAR

Anyway, rise above.

  <title>In Your Face AAA and CABO</title>

This morning, my princess made me a happy man indeed. I mean, every morning when I wake up and find out that I am married to her, I'm a happy man.

However, this morning, she made me extra happy when, during our chat, she mentioned that the three foot passing law was passed.

Thus, the state government of California finally has shown some respect to all the cyclists of their state.

That's right, buzzing is now more than bad manners, it's officially illegal.

I was so overjoyed this morning that I rode to work on a cloud of bliss. I felt like shouting to every passing motorist:

"We did it! Three foot passing, mutha!"

My bliss could didn't dissipate until i tried explaining the law to a fellow cyclist.

He asked me a series of well-meaning and intelligent questions such as:

"But how will they enforce it?"

and

"Does this include bike lanes because most bike lanes I ride on are in 50 MPH zones. Do cars need to slow down to 21 miles per hour to pass a cyclist riding at 6 MPH?"

Ug, I have no clue how this is going to be enforced.

In my heart of hearts, I know that this isn't going to change much.

Still, it was nice to have one more lemon to have the bike haters suck on.

Plus, this is a great precedent to build on.

For one, the AAA said that the law is bad because there's no previous law which requires a motorist to guess the speed of an object that they are passing. Well guess what triple A, now there is.

Now we can make as many laws requiring motorists to have a smidgen of common sense and good manners that we want to including those where they have to estimate what 15 MPH is.

I'd argue that if someone can NOT estimate 15 MPH, they probably shouldn't be driving.

I'd also argue that if everyone had good manners and common sense, we wouldn't need this law nor any other law.

I can see the AAA stance against the first murder laws.

BEGIN SARCASM

"We could kill people before, so it hardly makes sense that we'd make such a fun thing illegal especially when our members do it all the time."

END SARCASM

I'm even more happy to get in the face of every member of CABO, who, rumor has it, is not pretending to be in favor of the law.

OK, I gotta go, I have some phone calls to make and some gloating to do.

  <title>Camera-antitaxis</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/07/01/camera-antitaxis/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Camera-antitaxis

In biology there's the notion of phototaxis:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phototaxis

This basically means that some animals more towards light.

What does this have to do with cycling?

For one thing, I have felt, for years, that there was some kind of magnetic pull on my bicycle as automobiles would try to get closer to me. 

This made no sense to me so I told myself that I was being paranoid, that they didn't see me, and that it didn't matter as long as they didn't hit me.

I found that these assumptions of mine might not be totally true.

This isn't information that I want to know. I want to learn things that make me happier not things that upset me. I have no urge to dig deep below to find the dark core of evil within everyone. I think that the book _The Lord of the Flies_ sucked.

Besides being boring, it was also overly depressing and probably not really true. Besides, I _like_ to root for the villains anyway. I rooted for Darth Vader. Usually I feel that the hero is a pompous twit, and I really hope he will die knowing that this wish is thwarted by the idiot, obligatory, Hollywood ending. Still hope springs anew.

Thus, I wasn't trying to find a new villain to hate. I was just trying to gather evidence to present to anyone who would listen about the inane blocking of a bicycle lane in order to alert drivers that a car lane, ahead, is blocked.

[caption id="attachment_562" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="Anatomy of a Death Trap"]<a href="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/cimg2516.jpg"><img src="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/cimg2516.jpg?w=300" alt="Sign Hogs Whole Lane" title="San Diego Death Trap" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-562" /></a>[/caption]

OK, this is negative, too, but the story title was funny, I think: "Roadside Death Trap: San Diego Style". :)

Anyway, there I was snapping photos on the side of Fairmount. I took some shots of the annoying sign.

Then I turned around to get a shot of the road just to give the reader an idea of the bigger picture. I know, I'm an artist. :)

As soon as I turned my tiny camera lens on the road, I noticed something: taxis.

That's right, movement away from the stimulus, but instead of phototaxis I saw camera-taxis. Or rather camera-antitaxis because they were moving away from me.

That's right, automobiles that usually got a little closer to the white line while passing me actually changed an ENTIRE LANE to avoid being photographed. 

[caption id="attachment_560" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="Usually love to hug my gutter suddenly struggle to give me a whole lane when there&#039;s a camera"]<a href="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/cimg2518.jpg"><img src="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/cimg2518.jpg?w=300" alt="Camera Shy Cars" title="Camera Shy Cars" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-560" /></a>[/caption]


Thus, I came to some conclusions:

1. If, even at high speeds, they can see a little man standing on the side of the road, snapping pictures, they can see a much later bicycle with a little man on it.

2. These motorists are highly motivated to avoid having their boring ass cars in a photo to change an ENTIRE LANE, but the notion of giving a fellow human space or even SAVING HIS LIFE it's too freakin' hard to do.

3. Since they could see me, why the fuck were they getting closer to me in the first place?

Now I am open to evidence to the contrary.

I believe in universal love, thus, I will love my enemy just the same.

Not so much for their sake, but for mine. I operate better when I am not totally in hate with every piece of shit "human" around me.

But this is a very interesting finding, indeed.

I find it to be a beginning of research rather than a definitive conclusion.

So the null hypothesis remains open.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Go Speed Racer</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[OK, whenever I write a post like this, this song goes through my song:

[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzCukmO4fhg&amp;w=425&amp;h=349]

"Arguing with white dudes on the Internet."

Which, as a white guy, it's like looking in a mirror and making scary faces.

Anyway, I have been thinking of the Quislings in our midst who claim want more cyclist then they do everything in their power to discourage people.

I recall this quote:

"Retain and expand the ability of bicyclists to act and be treated as drivers with equal rights and responsibilities on roads."

Suddenly, it all came together.

Instead of being so permissive, _I_ should want to ban things, too.

Unlike some of my cycling colleagues, I am NOT in favor of wiping out homeless people, and forcing everyone to ride single file in the middle of the lane while wearing Lycra with ears open and heads covered like the cyclists form of hijab.

No, I'm going to call for a ban on things that I personally don't like. Once I started thinking in the Let's Ban Shit Mindset, I realized how much fun it could be. Also, realizing that I banning things is even more fun when you do it in groups, I realized that I had to come up with some logical arguments that were congruent with contemporary intellectual climate.

Thus, I feel that if cyclist believe in the above quote, they would join me in a call for a ban on using our city streets for cycling racing.

Racing cyclists are the useful idiots of the cycling community because they are the first thing in motorist's minds when they think of cyclists.

If a cycling commuter wonders why a motorist sees red when he sees you, it is because of the racers.

The presence of so many racers in San Diego makes people believe that cycling is just for recreation. Thus cycling looks trivial to a motorist who has to drive pets to the vet and children to school.

The thought that some cyclists could be going to important, adult, and well-paying jobs on our bicycles, and that, we, too, might be in a hurry because we are late, is absent from the average San Diego motorist's mind.

Despite our marginal worth, the average San Diego driver is kind to us which just goes to show how accommodating people are here.

However, as cyclists, I think we should love the motorists back.

One way we could both show respect and to cultivate it from motorists is to not speed and to not wear Lycra or any other kind of racing gear. We would like to avoid off the impression that we are a douche bags who are only using the the streets to exercise while taking the lane from IMPORTANT PEOPLE.

After all, here's how motorists sees the average cyclist:

[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHHfjxjp0So&amp;w=425&amp;h=349]

This is the only explanation on why people see a harmless, humble, two wheeled vehicle as the "biggest threat to safe streets." Also, it is the main reason that <a href="http://www.bikeradar.com/news/article/anti-cycling-facebook-page-gains-32000-fans-24554/">the anti-cycling facebook page</a> has 32,000 followers.

How to reverse this trend?

I think that we should police ourselves and get the racers off the road and onto bicycle racing tracks. Most importantly, however, is that we need to stop the notion that cycling is just for sport.

Image a world where most people cycled to the grocery store. Occasionally, you'd see people motoring around, full speed, in race cars with NASCAR stickers in the windows, helmets on their heads, and auto-racing suits on their torsos.

While you are plodding along on your bicycle at a speed that makes it feel OK for children to run in front of your bicycle (because you can stop in time), other people are racing along like they are in the Dayton 500.

In this world, are going to see motorists as a danger that must be stopped.

In fact, you are going to conclude that this sport is inherently dangerous only suited for expert athletes.

And when proper infrastructure is build, you will come to the wrong conclusion.

For example, here's a video which shows how safe cycling is in a cyclo-track in DC. Most cyclists are riding nicely just like most motorists have an OK time on the freeway. It's not perfect, there's always cause for complaint with the traffic and imperfect drivers, but come on, a eight mile per hour collision between two bicycles isn't the biggest danger our civilization is facing.

In fact, the video brought tears to my eyes because my own capital city was growing up, become a more mature and civilized place.

Despite, this, the video was presented in the most negative light as propaganda against cycling. If I didn't know any better, this would have looked like Copenhagen where nearly everyone rides their bicycles. Compare to the patronizing tone, and the dinky turnout that racing advocates have plagued us with.

Also, it is clear that the commuter is unfamiliar with more dense urban design. This design does have more frequent stops and slower commute speeds. However, since things are closer trip TIMES are often shorter and this is the goal of good planning. Often the uninformed feel that faster speeds lead to shorter trip times, but this is rarely the case from a design standpoint.

[vimeo http://vimeo.com/23743067]

Thus, as cyclists, we must pressure people to stop wearing Lycra, stop riding racing bicycles on the street that are impractical for carrying things, and to ride at safe speeds at all times. You can keep on riding on sidewalks, salmoning, and weaving as long as you do so respectfully. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[One of my favorite quotes is from the third Road Warrior movie: Mad Max Beyond the Thunderdome where Tina Turner says, "Death is listening."

I often think of that quote especially during times, like the other day, when I read an article about how "we never really think about death."

While that's true for most people, I'm sure that most cyclists have had a thought or two about death especially when you are riding into the valley down a street which makes you merge with fast moving traffic.

While I don't want to die, I'm OK, on paper, about myself dying right now due getting hit by car because I'd be doing the thing I love, the third funnest thing in the whole world. It's nice to know that you have an opportunity to die living the way that you want.

Thus, when people talk about the supposed dangers of cycling, my eyes glaze over. I'd cycle even if it was dangerous which it is certainly not.

I think that the true dare devils of this world are the motorists. There are deaths on even the biggest vehicles and ironically some of the bigger trucks are most often more deadly.

Motorists are mostly oblivious, though I am very afraid when I ride in a motor vehicle. The fear is kind of fun, though, like riding an amusement park ride.

I, too, am becoming oblivious to fear and to death while I ride which is probably because I do the same ride daily.

This really scares me because I feel that fear keeps us safe like Vanderbuilt talks about in his brilliant _Traffic_. People who _feel_ safe are actually in the most danger because as the Zen monk says, "attention, attention, attention." Fear makes us pay attention.

Every now and then I get into a scary place where I find myself passing on the left when people are really slow. Then I realize that I am totally insane and once again, I impatiently struggle to cultivate the best of mental powers: patience and discipline.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Often I say, "we are apes," which I still think it is true to a large extent. However, in some ways, I can see us being herd animals in some ways. By herd animal, I mean something like a horse or a cow.

The main emotions that allows a herd animal to survive is fear. Herd animals are always on the move, and they always stick together.

Contrast this to predators who are usually territorial and try to keep others of their kind out so they can limit access to prey and other delights. Predators have a drive to explore and to experience new things while herd animals are usually fleeing away from something bad.

When you run things based on fear rather than curiosity, you are going be safe in the short run, but you are also going to make some colossal mistakes that might hurt you in the future.

Our current built environment less than one hundred years old, but it's seen as better to stick to that rather than to continue the innovation that got us here in the first place.

For example, in Balboa Park, they are up in arms over the re-pedestrianization of a bridge. I say RE in front of pedestrianization because the El Prado bridge was built for people to walk across, originally. Now, the mayor wants to go back to that original design.

I think this is an excellent idea because Balboa is a city park, not an industrial nor office park. Yet, if you look at an aerial photo, you'd think you were looking at a mall with a few big box stores rather than a place where children can run without their parents constantly scanning, just like the herd animal on the horizon, for danger. Children of all ages will be free to explore in relative quiet and peace.

What about the venues in the park?

I say they should do two things: either figure out a way to convince some of the millions of tourists to come without their cars. This should not be hard because many visitors never rent cars. When I ride the bus, I always see older couples in Hawaiian shirts and large brimmed hats. They are often nice people, but don't you prefer for them to on a bus rather than taking up another parking spot, making more freeway traffic, and circling around another cul-de-sac?

If they have to walk past a sea of parking, they might not come to the museum. Especially in this bad economy, it's hard to go on vacation and pay for entertainment. Now they need to shell out for a car, too.

Pedestrianization of the park will actually create new parking spaces as the older ones are not filled, the notion of virtual parking spaces which is as close to getting something for free as I can imagine. I know at least two people who live nearby the park who will walk if they can, but if it's too much of a hassle, aka now, to walk, they will drive. There's two free spots right there, and I don't even know too many people. Think of the thousands more free spots ripe for the picking if they have the vision and guts to see the pedestrian plan through?

The second solution is to move the venues to the valley where they can use the hundreds of spaces which are vacant most of the year due to the laws where they have to build spaces that are only used for a week before Christmas, but otherwise lie fallow yearly.

Heck, they could even make a drive in theatre and drive through art galleries so they don't even need parking anymore. 

Problem solved. Next.

Instead they act as if this is carmageddon which is only found, these days in LA: 
http://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/2011/06/405_freeway_closure_july_16_17_traffic_los_angeles_subway.php

Instead of innovating, like herd animals, many of us are finding fault on how the plan can fail. We are only looking for reasons to flee.

If we keep on mindlessly fleeing, we are going to find out that we have been herded by animals smarter and better thinking than us, predetors.

When we finally nitpick our way to the slaughterhouse, it's going to suck even if it was designed by Temple Gradin (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Grandin) herself.

  <title>Consideration 101</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Every now and again, an know-it-all comes to town to tell the rest of us poor schmucks how to ride our bicycles.

I don't know why, but there's only two big things that tick me off regarding cycling.

Here are some things that don't really bother me (too much) any more. 

Buzzing me, threatening my life. (Yawn). Sure it activates my autonomic nervous system. But I this is rare, and not really a threat to my self image.

The two things that really bother me are people claiming to be cyclists and arguing against infrastructure, and people telling me how to ride my bicycle.

Often, the later group does it out of noble sounding words such as "consideration", "personal responsibility", "safety", or some other nonsense term. This is a form of emotional manipulation and is part of BBF (blame bicyclists first) which seeks to blame every single cycling death, AIDS, and breast cancer on a bearded guy sitting on a two wheeled, self-propelled vehicle.

However, tis the season, so I, too, will put up my list of things that a cyclist can do to show "consideration" to others especially to their best friends, motorists of the world.

1. Vote to ban cycling racing. 

Cycling racing is evil because it makes cycling look dangerous. Helmets weren't taken seriously until a racer died. Now they have lame helmet law proposals everywhere.

Cycling racing is an environmental disaster with tiny packets of sugar and water strewn all over the place. It burns more petrol than not racing at all which makes it more expensive for the good citizens of the earth to drive their kids to school in a mini-van. Plus, it creates traffic delays which are the worst thing ever.

Finally, it sows confusion in people's minds making cycling look like it's only for the very fit.

Thus racing is totally inconsiderate to both cycling commuters and to motorists.

2. If someone threatens your life, thank them. Near death experiences are a rare gift. If someone gives you the gift of a movie of your whole life as well as a new perspective on life and an appreciation for being alive, embrace it. I usually give the person a dollar for their time.

3. Don't take the lane. Hug the side of the road so the faster, more important cars can get by. If someone is turning, pull your bike on the sidewalk. If someone honks at a light, get out of their way.

4. NEVER criticize, condemn or complain about another cyclist's riding style, their bike, or anything else. Never give advice to a cyclist either. One person's mistake is another person's adventure. Keep your ideas to yourself.

5. Same as #4, but about cycling commuting. If someone asks you, the ride was great. Forget about any mishap or disrespect you saw on your ride. Life's too short. Ask the guy in #2. :)

6. Wear what you want. It's a bike ride, not a fashion show. Most people are so obsessed with their phone calls, children, radio, and steering wheels to care what you have on. Still don't wear lycra because I do care about that. It's inconsiderate and shows support of #1. Just say no to silly clothes.

7. When you ride somewhere, don't brag about it. Don't brag about how far you rode, either. Nobody really gives a shit about your life. Their life is more important. If they do ask, keep your answers short because they are just being polite, they aren't going to transcribe your biography.

8. Never explain the law to people. Never talk back. In fact, if someone says shit to you, just say, "have a nice day" or best yet, just ignore them completely.

9. Sell your car. Or don't. But if you have a car, you'll probably drive most of the time. If you do that, you are a motorist which is totally fine. Motorists are among my best of friends. I just wouldn't let my sister marry one. :)

10.Yield even when you have the right of way. Traffic rules are annoying and confusing. If everyone rides really slow and is kind to others things will work better than if we all had to read a hundred page rules manual. Toss out the manual; your heart is all you need.

11. Lighten up. Life's short, it should be fun. Cycling is fun not a chore. There are no rules. Once you know how to ride, do it all the time and you'll get better. Don't waste time and money on book learning on cycling spend that time on the road.

Say "hi" to other cyclists even if it seems dumb. Kindness never hurt anyone. A simple hello from a fellow cyclist makes me happy for hours later. Why deny something so big when it's such a small act for you? Stony faced people look angry, friendless, depressed, and sour. They don't look cool.

Please don't take these rules seriously. I really don't care how you cycle or if you cycle at all. Just be happy.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Telling People to be Considerate is Inconsiderate</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently read an article that confused me.

http://commuteorlando.com/wordpress/2011/07/07/i-am-not-a-bicyclist/

This article is going to be used to push against ANY government spending for infrastructure.

It will also be used by people who pretend to bicycle but take the motorist's point of view on all conflicts.

Consideration is good. I ride with utmost consideration to all road users.

However, consideration is something that must be given freely not demanded.

Safety is the big red herring in the cycling world. Cycling is super-safe in all areas. I advocate for the right to ride on all roads including freeways right now.

In the future, I'd like to see the same respect given to cycling spending that motorist's get.

If they build a billion dollar freeway, I want a billion bucks spent on cycling. Also, a billion for pedestrians. By the way, this would be a level playing field and a "freer" market.

This is not fair to motorists.

Advocates are not fair. See above quote on cherry picking.

If an advocate is trying to be "fair" and they are arguing against cycling, they are not helping me. They might have the best of intentions, but they are useless to me.

In fact, it would be better if such advocates took up a new hobby such as knitting.

I don't like to be told how to ride. I don't think that's considerate.

Cycling is safe, and poses nearly no threat.

If we are going to try to shame cycling community into riding safer, we need to, first, spend ten times the amount of time lecturing motorists.

Cycletracks are not there to prevent collisions. This is a red herring. They are there to make people feel good about riding.

We seldom have collisions, but we ride every day.

Collisions are not bad. They are not to be avoided.

Traffic engineers have gotten good about making collisions less common, but the ones that do occur are more deadly.

When pedestrians collide with one another rarely is anyone hurt.

We should have the same goal for all modes.

I got hit by a car, and I was fine. I got hit by a bike and I was fine. I ditched my bike to avoid an idiot pedestrian who saw me and stepped in front of me. I was unhurt.

Had there been higher speed motor vehicle traffic, I would have been badly hurt.

Each time I had a collision, I learned something.

Now we want to avoid collisions at all costs. We have irrational fears of the world.

Of course, we should avoid collisions, but we should make them something we can hobble away from.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Herding Cars</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Herding Cars

Previously, I wrote about us being a herd animal.

I got the idea from Monty Roberts, who is known for his skills in riding wild horses without violence in about half an hour or so.

The "conventional", cruel method takes about two weeks to break the horse.

One of the ways that he communicates with the horse is through body language.

He believes that horses have a universal body language.

I'm wondering if the same thing is true for motorists. Watching cars on a freeway is much like watching a bunch of cows following a chute in a slaughter house.

I know that behind that metal and glass is a human being who is most likely partially distracted at best. Their main motivation is to not stop and to get in front of as many other cars as possible.

I believe that each time a motorist is able to pass a car or to cheat a red light, there's a little burst of pleasure in the reward center of their minds. When they have to stop--especially if someone gets in their way--there's a little twinge of pain.

I realize that knowing an organism's pleasure and pain or reward and punishment is the simplest way for operant conditioning, but I am wonder if there's not a higher language on top of this simplistic view.

Monty learned to build rapport with horses by watching the horses in the wild. I wonder if we might be able--by observation and experimentation--to tame the automobiles of the wild west.

A strange, thought, true, but perhaps the start of a beautiful journey. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Wind on the Scales of a Sidewalk Salmon</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_607" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="What it looks like when I look down"]<a href="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/cimg2520.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-607" title="Blurry Wheel on Bike" src="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/cimg2520.jpg?w=300" alt="My Wheel from my POV" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]

&nbsp;

I do realize that some of my past posts have been a bit argumentative or even negative.

I have been studying, in their native habitat, Quisling advocates in order to better understand their reasoning.

Of course, their native habitat is discussion forums. Oh, how my princess advises me against such a waste of time. I should rather ride my bicycle or even stare at a wall. I plan on doing both of these things more and ranting online less.

In order to stop the tide of negativity, I have decided that I need a mental list of things that make me happy. First is, of course, my princess. Second is my friends and the fact that I have two close friends I work with as well as many other friends on the streets. :)

This morning, what made me really happy was the wind on my skin while I cycled.

This morning was 100% perfect for cycling. It was overcast, but warm enough to wear shorts and sandals only.

When I get to the final hill that I have to climb, I made the right choice and I sidewalk salmoned all the way up.

For the uninitiated, salmoning means riding one's bicycle against traffic. In the cycling world, this is considered to be naughty. To ride on the sidewalk, is also naughty. Thus, sidewalk salmoning is deliciously naughty squared. This, in addition to going shirtless, made the climb a delight.

[caption id="attachment_609" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="Qualcomm Bike Path: A trail of my own"]<a href="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/cimg2497.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-609" title="Qualcomm Bike Path" src="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/cimg2497.jpg?w=300" alt="Qualcomm Bike Path" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]

&nbsp;

Sometimes I climb on the other side of the hill, but no matter how much I focus on feeling my body and skin the passing cars rattles me, enough, so that I find myself pedaling faster than I like.

I love to ride slowly up a hill and feel each muscle in my feet and legs moving. I can only do this when I go slowly.

So it is a perfect day thanks to good weather, a bicycle, and happy thoughts.

The Qualcomm stadium bike path, which I take to work, not only goes past a stadium parking lot (which is usually totally empty), but also past a small stream. I'm sure that this is the most efficient use of prime real estate in San Diego, which was most likely a farm. Much nicer now. :)

Imagine my surprise to see sewer guys in the path.

The place actually did smell like a sewer. They seemed to be flushing a drain line.

[caption id="attachment_625" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="Truck in Bike Lane"]<a href="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/cimg2500.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-625" title="Truck in Bike Lane" src="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/cimg2500.jpg?w=300" alt="Truck in Bike Lane" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]

These guys were really nice. I walked my bike past them, and they even laughed at my joke, "Tickets are doubled in work zones." :)

Beyond that fence is a tiny stream. Or was, now there was just mud that smelled like a toilet.

[caption id="attachment_627" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="Where there was a stream, now only mud."]<a href="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/cimg2502.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-627" title="Muddy Stream" src="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/cimg2502.jpg?w=300" alt="Muddy Stream" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]

I was so happy to see the truck in the steam which was dredging it out.

[caption id="attachment_628" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="Digging a stream"]<a href="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/cimg2501.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-628" title="Digging a stream" src="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/cimg2501.jpg?w=300" alt="Digging a stream" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]

Overall, it was an excellent commute because I like to see this work being done; it seems really important, and I was happy to have a chance to watch for a short while.

I saw more workers on the bike path on that day than cyclists on the busiest cycling day ever, bike to work day.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Today, I took a ride down to the big box electronics store to buy new headphones.

Outside was a man with petitions. I usually sign all of them so I asked to read them.

I have no clue why people get a bit agitated when I want to read the petition. I take the whole thing very seriously. Why would I sign something unless I'm sure I agree with it?

I think I found the answer and it makes me sad. I think that this is because people have no idea that there are others who disagree with them. They think that if they like it then everyone must like it.

I find this to be baffling in the age of the internet where we have so much more access to other people's points of view.

This reminds me of the VC arguments I wasted my time on last week.

The thing that I hated about the VC arguers was that they were totally disrespectful of those who disagreed with them.

I tend to think that people who differ in point of view are not evil, but rather just see things differently.

The VC people think that to disagree means to be misinformed and cowardly.

That's, obviously, totally insulting.

Similarly, I disagreed with both petitions.

One was pension "reform" which really means making the people who all ready had pensions to have to renegotiate. I think it's wrong to make people fight for money in a contract that they were all ready offered. My princess is an accountant, and I told the man this.

I didn't get in an argument, I just told him that I thought there were lots of lies surrounding pensions as most people don't even know what they are: deferred compensation. So to deny someone a salary is to deny them the salary that you originally offered them.

Usually this is known as stealing or fraud.

The other was union busting which I also disagreed with. Of course, it didn't say that, it wanted to "level the playing field". I could see why that would be appealing to many people who were raised to misunderstand the history of money.

I was upset about the bill because I feel that it's going to force people to refight all their battles again. But I don't think that the people who wrote it are evil just self-interested.

Still, it is hard not to demonize people I disagree with, but I am trying not to.

  <title>The Booze Delusion</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/07/18/the-booze-delusion/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, there was a collision where yet another motorist killed a cyclist in a collision:

http://www.10news.com/news/28571866/detail.html

"Police said the driver of the SUV was not under the influence but somehow lost control of the vehicle."

I thought this was quite odd because the biggest cause of motor vehicle deaths are attributed to speed not alcohol.

I really believe it's good that MADD tries to get drunks off the road, but they have inadvertently helped to cement the myth in people's minds that if we don't drink and drive then motoring is quite safe.

In the previous case where a motorist took the lane--bike lane that is--and turned their vehicle into a flaming pile, the motorist was speeding.

Also, there was this stupid study:

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2016044/Children-likely-injured-car-crash-grandparents-driving-parents-are.html?ITO=1490

"Children 'less likely to be injured' in a car crash when their grandparents - not their parents - are driving"

I thought this was stupid because researchers had no idea _why_ children were safer with grandparents. Don't they realize that older people tend to drive slower?

They didn't compare the number of collisions in the data, which I think should be another piece of information. It's obvious that in a crash, the slower you are driving the less injured you will be. This should be totally obvious.

Personally, none of this bothers me. I realize that people speed both because they are in a hurry and because it's fun. I recall driving with some guy in my small, hometown who had a sports car, and he took us up to 100. That was really fun.

[Disclaimer: I'm not advocating for breaking the law, and I never broke the law. Ever. I'm just saying that people do these things.]

Despite the fact that collisions happen, I think that motoring is both safe and fun.

I was also to see that they didn't mention a helmet in the story which is awesome. Also, they didn't even blame the cyclist which was probably because he wasn't on the road. So overall, this was a step in the right direction.

"Cyclists said the spot where Venuto was hit is probably the least dangerous because at that spot, the bike path is separated from the freeway by 30 to 40 feet of an embankment."

This touched a sore spot with me because I'd like to ride on the freeway as is, and I hope that this doesn't stop that. There's a government official who likes cycling and wants to make my dream of riding my bicycle on the 8, legally, a priority.

I did agree that these kinds of things are rare, but I was a bit sad that the cyclists didn't come to the motorist's defense and ask not only about their own safety, but also the motorists. What's being done to make the drivers safer? Should they wear helmets? It seems like they can't keep their vehicles on the road. I guess it's really hard. I don't drive much, and when I do, I do feel like it's quite difficult, and I'm always grateful to have gotten there safely.

Finally, I got a chuckle out of the mean people's comments who didn't think that there was any benefit to cycling or at least they couldn't see an immediate benefit to themselves so they thought it should be defunded.

This was funny because bicycling spending in San Diego is less than a dime per person per year. So if any San Diegan has any problems with "their money" (sic) wasted on cycling, let me know, and we'll meet up and I'll give you back your dime. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Nor is a bongo. :)

Kidding aside, my posts are starting to sound like lame ass Public Service Announcements without guitars, but with stupid jokes to make the whole thing easier to swallow.

On the other hand, if my "eat your vegetables" and "racism is bad" style of posts are stupid, what about the stuff that prompts them like an annoying quote in the NY Times, talking about DC:

"Some of these poorer residents saw revitalization as code for efforts to drive them out, and the building of dog parks and bike and streetcar lanes as efforts by affluent whites to re-arrange spending priorities to suit themselves."

http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/18/us/18dc.html?src=me&amp;ref=general

There are a million things that are wrong with this.

Like, do only white people have dogs? What gives?

I think my annoyance as a bicycle being used a symbol in people's minds rather than what it is to me which is a piece of metal with two tiny rubber wheels on it.

I have seen a bicycle equated with liberalism, ecology, hipsterism, terrorism (no kidding), the United Nations, wealth, snobby elitism, theft of tax dollars, and even being white.

I think that the problem is that some people just don't like bicycles, and I think that's just fine. I don't like watching ESPN, but I'm not going to characterize sports fans as anything else than people who like to watch sports.

But this attitude of a bicycle being a symbol isn't just outside the bike community, but inside, too.

For example, there are a lot of people who look down on cruisers. I used to until I realized I was being bikist. 

Anyway, I don't like it when people characterize my bicycle as anything else than a lump of metal and rubber that I put my ass on. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm in a good mood today. I'm usually in a good mood, but many times my posts sound angry or at least they have some kind of conflict.

Overall, I think that's good because we need some kind of drama in our lives to keep us entertained.

On the other hand, I really don't want people to think that my life is miserable or anything.

Thus, this post is probably going to be totally boring or uplifting or sappy depending on how you look at things.

As usual, I had great chats with my princess. This always keeps me in a good mood.

My commute was fun as usual.

[caption id="attachment_642" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="Top of Fairmount Right Before We Descend into the Valley"]<a href="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/cimg2561.jpg"><img src="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/cimg2561.jpg?w=300" alt="Top of Fairmount" title="Top of Fairmount" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-642" /></a>[/caption]

I love this part of my commute, and I look forward to it every day. I loved going down here with the Danes as it was really entertaining to see their reaction.

[caption id="attachment_643" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="This is my hardest merge"]<a href="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/cimg2569.jpg"><img src="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/cimg2569.jpg?w=300" alt="Nasty Merge" title="Nasty Merge" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-643" /></a>[/caption]

Then I arrive at work where I have two really good friends, and many more people are friendly except for the ones that give me a good challenge in my social and work skills.

Finally at the end of the day, I'll either have a great meal with my princess or some good friends or both.

Last night, I had my favorite food with some people from Virginia.

I'm sure everyone is either bored or ill by now so I'll stop.

No worries, I have many more whiny and bile laden posts.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Sometimes, when riding my bicycle, my mind goes in places that aren't pretty.

Sometimes I'm afraid to talk about them because I don't want to ruin my reputation.

I don't know what brings these thoughts on: sometimes, a blog post and sometimes a conversation with my wife.

[caption id="attachment_648" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="Where we all end up"]<a href="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/cimg2525.jpg"><img src="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/cimg2525.jpg?w=300" alt="Dead Squirrel" title="Dead Squirrel" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-648" /></a>[/caption]


This morning, I thought of one of two big topics: death.

This is something that I talked about before, but each time I think about it, it's like it's happening for the first time.

Today, I was trying to take some photos of people who love to drive in the gutter. I almost think that should be a TV show when I got buzzed a lot.

I know that most people do this deliberately. Now that the initial anger is gone, I started thinking more about the people behind the glass and steel coming inches from my face.

If I ever, ever did this, this would be the act that I was most ashamed of.

Today, I, since I had a camera out, I tried to snap photos of the drivers as they went over the white line into the gutter. But as before, the minute I started documenting this, they stopped doing it.

Now, I do believe in the basic goodness of humanity, but we are still animals who respond to our environments. Thus, I don't see the point in worrying about something vague like "character" to protect us. Rather, I think people should have <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-bicycle-law-20110721,0,3219222.story">incentives</a> in their environments to do good.

This is why I am a bit shocked that so many people on the road are kind. I'm also amazed that motoring is so safe because to me, on paper, it looks like a very terrible idea to force people to use their nervous systems--no matter how old and shaky--in order to navigate at speeds that outstrip millions of years of evolution in order to not die.

But here we are.

And here I am on the side of the highway desperately trying to make eye contact to get some kind of human to human connection with the person who might kill me.

I really do hate murderers, but there's something a bit odd about contemplating the life of one's own killer. Where did they grow up? How was their childhood? What are their dreams?

In this way, I do have a strange understanding of the book I could not read, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_%28J._G._Ballard_novel%29">Crash.</a>

At the time I thought it was sick. But now I see that Ballard was tapping into something very primal and deep in the human psyche.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Aside from meditating on my bicycle, I also like to chant.

This helps especially when my mind is so stirred up with thoughts that meditation just makes the pain worse.

Fortunately, the last few months have been quite happy. I mean, I do feel like I am on a bike tour every day.

[caption id="attachment_657" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="Short Cut Through the Golf Course"]<a href="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/cimg2574.jpg"><img src="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/cimg2574.jpg?w=300" alt="Golf Course Trail" title="Golf Course Trail" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-657" /></a>[/caption]

However, I still try to memorize the following <a href="http://www.berzinarchives.com/web/en/archives/e-books/unpublished_manuscripts/bca_shantideva/translation/engaging_bodhisattva_05.html">chant</a> in order protect myself.

"(1) With the wish to safeguard my happiness,
I need to work hard and safeguard my mind;
If I'm unable to safeguard my mind,
I'll also be unable to safeguard my happiness."

Yes, I changed training to happiness because I'm actually not really worried about training to become enlightened, I just want to be a bit happier in this world. However, I do find that these sort of chants just the sauce to keep me going.

Basically, this line means that I must watch over my own mind to see when I am going downhill and to stop myself _before_ I get too far down.

It also means I need to watch my where my mind is going before I do something that I regret.

For example, if I wasn't obsesses with that douche bag at the party, I wouldn't have spilled his girly drink over his lap. :)

Just kidding. The last sentence didn't happen. :)

"(2) Left to run loose, the elephant of my mind can ravage me
With (a joyless realm of) unrelenting pain.
Untamed, rutting elephants in this (world)
Can't cause me such harm."

In the next phrase, we have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor">metaphor</a> which compares the mind to a wild elephant.

The untrained elephant is commonly compared to the mind because an elephant can cause great harm when wild, but it can also be tamed. 

I love elephants, actually. I think they are really beautiful, and they are one of my favorite mammals. I was into rhinos as my personal animal, but now I'm all about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_Badger">honey badger.</a>


"(3) But, if the elephant of my mind is firmly bound
By the rope of mindfulness on every side,
All fears will vanish and everything constructive
Will come into my hands."

Here it sounds as if I think that the whole world, right now, is perfect. In a sense, I do agree with this. I try not to be critical of things except when I am.

That is, when I am riding, I really try to enjoy myself.

When sitting down with friends, I like to sharpen my metaphorical knives with my friends over our enemies who create this traffic nightmare.

But overall, things are fine.

Those who rode their bikes down Fairmount only a few times, or saw it in a car: it's not as bad as it looks. One can get used to it.

To paraphrase _The Stranger_, "a man can get used to almost anything."

(6) ...in this way, all fears,
As well as immeasurable sufferings,
Come from the mind.

  <title>Bicycle Dating For Men I</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/07/28/bicycle-dating-for-men-i/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Bicycle Dating for Men

This is a HUGE topic so I am breaking this into several posts.

I usually don't talk too much about things I don't have much experience with.

For example, I have little experience meeting women, falling in love, and all that.

Like most guys, I have had tons of casual conversations and outings with women, but there were very few whom I thought worthy of my pursuit. In general, I was looking for the perfect woman, and I found her fairly early on.

However, I am tired of hearing all this nonsense about men needing a car to date women.

The only people who say such things have had little experience with women when they owned a car. So this is just an assumption based on a false premise.

All my really good dates were without a car.

I did date a little bit in High School when I was stuck in the delusion that I needed a car to date, but now that's over with.

Where did this delusion come from in the first place?

For one thing, if you ask a woman if she'd date a guy without a car, she will say "no."

Only total losers will date losers, and most women don't hate themselves that much.

The media has put a lot of hard work into making those without cars to be losers. 

In many plots, success == getting a car: the end of Good Will Hunting, for example.

Thus, you should not present yourself as the "guy without a car." In fact, you shouldn't talk about cars or bikes or transportation at all unless that's her passion.

People can only think of one thing at a time, and if you are an interesting enough person, you'll be in before she cars to look at what manufacturer's name is emblazoned on your combustion engine.

Yes, there are some women who will ask you, immediately, what kind of car you drive then she'll reject you if you don't have the right kind of car.

If so, she's blown if for herself. Just walk away. This woman is trouble, and the sooner you get away from her, the better. In fact, by not having a car--especially a nice car--you saved yourself a lot of time.

If a girl is into a guy she doesn't even know, just because of his vehicle, she's fake and not worth it.

Overall, you will have just as much success with women, if not more, if you start to value yourself, and to think about the woman's feelings rather than shiny trinkets that can attract her.

Plus, you'll have the added benefit of spending time with quality people rather than just boring gold diggers.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Where to meet them?

First here are some places NOT to meet them: work (never date anyone at work) or the street (don't harass women on the street) or biking events (usually women go to these to ride their bike, duh, and not to be hit on otherwise they'd go to a meat market).

In fact, if you go out to explicitly meet women, usually you'll have a kind of creepy and/or needy vibe which is the biggest turn off besides being a child molester.

Go to meetups singles and otherwise, and talk to everyone of both sexes and all ages. The idea isn't to "hookup", but rather to learn more about the rainbow of humanity.

Eventually, you should ask for people's phone numbers if they are interesting enough, and if you have enough rapport. You could tell them you want to "continue the conversation" or you could find a specific activity that you both enjoy.

Again, don't talk about the bicycle too much, and only if it comes up naturally. After a while, people will like you for who you are and they will accept your cycling as part of your original, likable self.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I don't know what "too crowded to meet anyone" means. If you are good at meeting people, you can meet them almost anywhere. People go to meetups to meet people so you should do that. If you are having problems, you are probably either not trying at all--that is not starting conversations--or trying too hard--pushing for something in way that seems desperate.

Also, there are plenty of other places to meet people. You should meet people on group rides--which are sometimes meetups--but please, people stop hovering around the ladies--it's annoying and will not lead to where you think it will lead.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Cycling Wabi-sabi Style</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I have noticed that the disease of perfectionism it permeating much of the bicycle world from all sides.

There's the utility cyclist perfectionism that wants separated and dedicated bicycle paths or they won't ride.

Then there's the notion that every piece of infrastructure and every law has to be put under a microscope to ensure that racers can race--anti-social or not--their bikes on the city streets.

If one bad law gets passed or if one bike path gets put in then it's curtains for biking forever.

It's almost as if the whole cycling world is depressed.

Except for me. I love bicycling in this excellent weather, and even if the weather sucked, I'd most likely be living in a sweet compact city. So it's all good.

As Will says, even if you are lost and stuck on the side of a highway, at least you're ON YOUR BIKE. 

Isn't that what it's all about?

Still, the perfectionism is grating.

This is because as _Feeling Good_ says, "Perfection is man's ultimate illusion...it promises riches and delivers misery...Everything can be improved if you look at it closely enough...So if you strive for perfection, you are going to be a loser in whatever you do."

And it's true. There's nothing good enough for some people so we pick nothing instead.

It's totally demoralizing and paralyzing. This is the reason we are, in 2011, in San Diego. Each time we try to make something, self-appointed "experts" put it under a microscope.

What really drives me bananas is their double standard towards other forms of city spending, especially infrastructure.

I do think that this perfectionist point of view is very damaging for cycling.

Here are some ways this is so, from _Feeling Good_:

1. Fear of mistakes (and the omnipresent spectre of "liability") keep things from becoming truly great. In fact, I'd argue that fear of "liability" actually makes things more dangerous because it disallows things that have made cycling more safe in other countries.

2. It makes cyclists intolerant of others. This is especially true in the VC/Cycling Savy/Whatever Else They Call Themselves This Week. There is more whining about homeless, bike paths, and salmon, and less actual cycling. Screw that.

A shitty cyclist is better than no cyclist at all.

3. It keeps us from doing experiements to discover new ways of planning the city. How many experiments have been torpedoed due to "lack of data?" (sic) 

We're so afraid of making mistakes that we don't do anything that isn't all ready "legal".

This makes the world boring and cycling stagnates because there's nothing new coming out of Sac and nothing new being built.

Thankfully, this attitude is dying off, and the next generation sees the world as beautiful in its imperfection, an attitude summed up in the Wabi-sabi point of view: ...one of beauty that is "imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete". It is a concept derived from the Buddhist assertion of the Three marks of existence (三法印, sanbōin?), specifically impermanence (無常, mujō?).]]></content:encoded>

  <title>In A Manner of Riding</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/08/02/in-a-manner-of-riding/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I have posted many times in the past speaking of how we should cherish all cyclists including those who bike on the sidewalk, salmon, etc.

I am writing today to clarify my earlier post because there seems to be a lack of understanding between compassion for people who behave badly and condoning their behavior. 

I guess this is because humans have a deep seated craving for enemies and the duality of good and evil. While common enemies are useful for social cohesion, it usually maps onto the world poorly, and it can create more problems than it solves.

I guess part of religion is about overcoming our normal human tendencies, for example, when Jesus said to "love your enemies."

Thus, we can all agree that it serves us well to look beyond the tiny mental prison we sometimes allow our humanity to trap us in.

Alan Bloom agrees, "Freedom of the mind requires not only, or not even especially, the absence of legal constraints but the presence of alternative thoughts. The most successful tyranny is not the one that uses force to assure uniformity, but the one that removes awareness of other possibilities." 

Thus, while one one hand, I don't think that cycling advocates should waste any time at all pointing their finger at scofflaw cyclists. I do believe that things work best when we try to follow the law as much as possible.

Ideally, this would be all the time, but at certain times, the law is murky such as 21202:

http://www.sebastiangibsonlaw.com/california-vehicle-code-section-21202a-traffic-ticket-court-fine-cost.html

"Any person operating a bicycle upon a roadway at a speed less than the normal speed of traffic moving in the same direction at that time shall ride as close as practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway..."

One who hates bicycles thinks "practicable" is in the gutter. One who loves bike racing in their minds, but rarely actually ride thinks this means taking a whole lane. While those of us who ride realize that it all really depends upon a lot of factors including how we feel at the time. If I feel like going faster, I'll take more lane and try to stay out of the door zone.

If I had a bad day, and I want to be left alone and to play Car Door RouletteTM, I'll ride in the infamous door zone. In most cases, for me, the later is more comfortable. And that's what San Diego is all about: comfort.

When I read garbage like this: "Bicyclists are also required to adhere to all other rules and regulations that motorists must adhere to, including but not limited to [I feel asleep here]"

My eyes glaze over. Who gives a shit?

Here's a good quote:

"Thus, when the Way is lost there is virtue
When virtue is lost there is humaneness
When humaneness is lost there is rightness
And when rightness is lost there is propriety [laws].
Now 'propriety' is the external appearance of loyalty and sincerity

And the beginning of disorder." --Loa Tzu

http://www.acmuller.net/con-dao/daodejing.html#div-39

The point is that if we had good manners, we don't need the law because people will do what they need to do and to get along.

When we are on the roads, we don't have laws and lawyers. There's no time to think about laws, we are all instinct and habit. It's all about our minds directing our bodies these reactions are through feelings.

When people plan for traffic they forget about their minds and bodies. We become a kind of robot who is perfect.

This is all nonsense.

Also, as I wrote before there's communication between cyclists and motorists and negotiation of space. All of this takes place in seconds. There's eye contact, and prediction on how people move.

The only real thing that makes any of this safer is good infrastructure.

We are all learning to be better motorists and cyclists each day, but many of us are new to the road. 

A six hour or even sixty hour class is not enough. We need to drive or ride daily and to pay attention or we will not improve.

After each ride, I evaluate everything I did and how to do it better next time.

Each time I see a motorist, I try to get into his or her little head to figure out what the hell they are going to do.

Laws are useless for this. They are after the fact to be used when I am dead.

But manners are here and now.

I get angry when I read this crap:

'Equally absurd is the claim that bicyclists must "yielding to vehicles lawfully on the highway, traveling at a lawful speed, generally faster than a bicyclist.'

The thing is that I don't mind yielding at all.  

Motorists yield to me when appropriate and visa versa.

Otherwise, this would be suicide.

This morning, in City Heights, I yielded to a truck that otherwise would have plowed me. Did I have the right of way? Yes. Did I yield. Yes. Do I care? No.

I think that the more we obsess over our rights and the law (on the road, advocacy in meetings is different) the angrier we get. I see people all the time go on about rights, and they are pissed off, but they look highly amusing because it's always funny to see someone who is both powerless and indignant especially if it's a guy.

This reminds me of the Internet Tough Guy. It's easy to be tough behind a keyboard.

So I'm going to be the Internet Nice Guy. Ride how you want, but generally, we get what we want when we have manners.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Critical Motorcade</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The most successful group ride in the world is Critical Mass. It is also, at the same time, the most loved, reviled, and disputed ride.

First of all, few people really know what Critical Mass is all about.

The main point of Critical Mass, according to the founders in San Franscisco was that it was about whatever the riders wanted it to be about. There's no main message rather it's subjective.

Thus, Critical Mass is like an ink blot test where people project their hopes, dreams, fears, frustrations, and hatreds of bicycles.

And that is beautiful.

People who are green and liberal tend to love it.

People who are conservative tend to hate it.

These rules aren't absolute.

People's feelings of Critical Mass and bicycles in general are far from being written in stone.

Critical Mass is not the devil and it's not a savior.

But it is fun.

In general the more experience someone has with Critical Mass the more they like it. The people who hate it the most are those who saw a ride, one time, and had a bad experience not unlike those cases when a new minority moves into a neighborhood and everyone judges their whole country based on the actions of one dude who might not even be sane back home.

Those who want to "control" it make is "safe" are those who don't ride it regularly. It's like the pope wanting to make the rules for a game he doesn't play.

Those who ride it just ride.

I usually shy away from Critical Mass because I don't wish people to think I'm a loon. I usually refer to it as a popular group ride, which it is.

The take home message from this is that Critical Mass doesn't define cycling in most people's minds. Most people are far more intelligent to sum up the entirety of cycling by one person's actions. 

Finally, people's minds change. I have personally changed the minds of several people who hated cyclists by the power of facts, reason, and deep emotional manipulation.

So if you like it ride it.

If you hate it don't bash it.

If you want to get your drink on in downtown San Diego be mindful of the date, and plan accordingly just like you would do for a Chargers game, ComicCon or any other city sanctioned recreational event.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Bombing Linda Vista to Downtown</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The other day, I found a new (to me) route from my job on Serra Mesa down to downtown with no big hills.

I started on Linda Vista.

Here's USD's campus which is totally on the side of a big hill which is so strange to me:

[caption id="attachment_675" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="Peek into USD"]<a href="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/cimg2632.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-675" title="Peek into USD" src="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/cimg2632.jpg?w=300" alt="Peek into USD" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]

I guess it would be cool to go to school in a castle:

[caption id="attachment_677" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="USD Castle"]<a href="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/cimg2640.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-677" title="USD Castle" src="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/cimg2640.jpg?w=300" alt="USD Castle" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]

I usually hate riding down big hills because I go too fast for comfort and my hand gets sore, but this time, it was really fun:

[caption id="attachment_678" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="Linda Vista Into the Valley"]<a href="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/cimg2642.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-678" title="Linda Vista Into the Valley" src="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/cimg2642.jpg?w=300" alt="Linda Vista Into the Valley" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]

This was probably the worst of the lot which was getting from Linda Vista onto Morena Blvd which, to me, is a disgusting sty of a road:

[caption id="attachment_679" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="Morena Merging"]<a href="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/cimg2643.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-679" title="Morena Merging" src="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/cimg2643.jpg?w=300" alt="Morena Merging" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]

Finally, I got to Old Town, but I still had a problem finding the secret street Cahoun which would get me through to downtown. In the past, I had to flag down a lycra rider to show me the way.

This time, I found it.

I also figured out why I couldn't find the way before. First of all, the way meant crossing a busy street where there was a concrete divider between me and the other side of the street. I wound up doing a crazy jay bike across the street, hiding behind the concrete divider while the slow, slow cars crawled by me then dashing across the street and salmoning back to my street. When I was done there was another thing in my way:

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="368" caption="Old Town Gets in the Way"]<img title="Old Town Gets in the Way" src="http://i1143.photobucket.com/albums/n631/fredollinger/cimg2648.jpg" alt="Old Town Gets in the Way" width="368" height="277" />[/caption]

Yes, there was a pedestrian area right in the away!

I could have walked by bicycle, but instead I went onto the cracked and unnecessarily steep Juan street where there are giant SUVs and Hummers parked all the way up while other similar behemoths try to squeeze by all the while people say things like, "you can do it", as if I'm five and I'm tying my shoes for the first time.

Still, if I could climb Juan, I could get out of there.

Fortunately, I was able to pick up Calhound again by going down Juan a few blocks then heading over again.
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Plastic Chilils" src="http://i1143.photobucket.com/albums/n631/fredollinger/cimg2649.jpg" alt="Plastic Chilis" width="614" height="461" /></p>
We can always tell how "authentic" a place is by the number of fake, plastic chilies on the door. Yum.

Next, I had to cross highway five. Yes, these highway things tend to slice up the city like Great Walls of China only much bigger and more expensive. Luckily, I was able to find a route right away, and I found that there was actually another Old Town. Like a bizzaro world where they called themselves Old Town, but everything was more ghetto and more real. I loved it.
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Bizarro Old Town" src="http://i1143.photobucket.com/albums/n631/fredollinger/cimg2650.jpg" alt="" width="368" height="277" /></p>
This lead me straight to the street which lead to Kettner which went the rest of the way downtown. From there, I knew where I was.

I made it to the bar in about 1:15 hours. Not bad.

I had a good time and that the bar, but I missed my friend because he was surrounded by friends.

Still, at the end of the day, I saw this sign which means something to the Danes:

<img class="alignright" title="Tivoli Bar" src="http://i1143.photobucket.com/albums/n631/fredollinger/cimg2652.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" />]]></content:encoded>

&nbsp;

I know that I post, ad nauseum, about how much I hate safety.

This is true to a degree, but it doesn't tell the whole story.

It's not that I don't care about safety at all.

In fact, I consider myself a bit OCD when it comes to safety; I just try not to be annoying about it.

I know that I am NOT the safest rider on the road, but I am one of the most paranoid, I have ever seen.

For example, I NEVER take a turn if I can't see around the corner. I never ride past an alley without slowing down, and craning my neck to see ahead. I look both ways on the _sidewalk_ just in case there's someone walking. This is something I almost never see anyone do, and they are always shocked when they see someone (me) actually walking on a sidewalk. I guess they thought it was part of the expressway or something.

I do sidewalk salmon, but I stop at each intersection and look all four ways then go very slowly. Usually, I'll walk my bike across the street.

In fact, last time, I got hit by a car, I was at a particularly dangerous intersection so I stopped, dismounted, and pressed the button. When I had the light, I was walking in the crosswalk, slowly, and I got pegged by a car who turned into the crosswalk without even looking at all.

When I ride, I often peek inside people's cars to see what their up to. Often they are looking down as if they are sitting in a couch or something.

So I'm super duper safe, but I get harassed by kind, well meaning people because I don't wear a helmet.

Give me a break.

Helmets protect you as much from getting killed as putting toilet paper on a seat protects you from disease.

Let's wake up. Just because someone has statistics doesn't mean that he's telling you an acurate story to go along with those numbers.

Just because someone uses scientific sounding terms doesn't mean that he's not full of shit.

And sometimes, the lazy me would argue often, it actually is better to do nothing at all than to do _something_.

  <title>Bicycle is vastly, hugely, mindbogglingly safe...</title>

"Space is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mindbogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space..." --Douglas Adams

http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy

This quote if an inspiration on my feeling for Bicycle safety:

"Bicycling is safe. Really safe. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mindbogglingly safe it is. I mean, you may think a short walk down the road is safe, but that's just peanuts to bicycling..."

Thus, I don't feel that cycling safety is the problem, but rather amnesia is. How are these disparate topics related? See if you can see if you can recall this strange juxtaposition.*

The fact that cycling is so absurdly safe should be obvious and banal, but the thing that makes it a topic of interest is the level of hysteria people have around my routine commute. My princess has it even worse--not the commute, but the people who's words have zero relationship to our experience and the danger we are in.

In the past, I have felt gagged on this issue because many of my best friends are motorists, and I didn't want them to think that I think that I am superior to them in any way.

I mean, I _am_ superior to most people, but cycling alone isn't what makes me superior. I despise the amount of smugness associated with bicycling especially the vile political aspect of it such as the obnoxious signs like, "20 Iraqi lives and 2 American soldiers saved by me riding this bicycle."

No offense to the rest of the world, but when I'm cycling, I'm mostly either meditating or focusing on mind reading the motorists around me so I don't have a lot of thoughts for anything else. But I do know that if someone comes off that smug about cycling, I don't want to have a beer with them.

Anyway, back to the safety of cycling. Why do people think it's so dangerous?

I think that it's like Philip Dick said, we are all in differing pockets of reality:

"Maybe each human being lives in a unique world, a private world different from those inhabited and experienced by all other humans. . . ." --Philip Dick

Here's an article on this point of view:

http://steelweaver.tumblr.com/post/8175553314/reality-as-failed-state-tl-dr-version-i-like-doing

"I believe part of the meta-problem is this: people no longer inhabit a single reality."--steelweaver

Thus, for many people, getting on a bicycle is totally insane. In fact, it's surprising that any bicycle commuter survives.

This is totally false according to any objective measurement of safety:

http://www.ite.org/crashes/categories.htm

As of this date, the number of cyclists who died was 450 and the number who died as Occupants of motor vehicles is 15,583.

Now, I have nothing against driving in a car, but we need to be consistant in our views.

If it is totally insane, and possibly immoral to our loved ones to risk oneself on a bicycle, if it turns out that cycling is safe and motoring is dangerous should we not cross apply all this hysteria to motoring?

The funny thing is that I have never seen this done.

Whenever I get harassed about how dangerous cycling is, and I snap and prove to the bully that actually their preferred mode is super-risky and mine is super-safe in comparison, the person walks away.

I believe that these people are like robots and that there is a little mechanism in their minds that resets. Everything that I have told them gets erased, and next time you hear the same nonsense from them about bicycle safety.

Thus, as you recall, the real answer to this whole conversation is amnesia.

* For those not in the know, the term _juxtaposition_ refers to the notion of taking two things that are UNRELATED and putting them next to one another. So please no comments which say, "Bicycling and amnesia aren't related! This post is so stupid and a total waste of time!" :)

  <title>Signs of a Quisling Advocate</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/08/09/signs-of-a-quisling-advocate/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="614" caption="Quisling Parking: They bitch to get off the road then the block bike paths with their cars..."]<img class=" " title="Quisling Parking Style" src="http://i1143.photobucket.com/albums/n631/fredollinger/cimg2549.jpg" alt="Bike Path Blocked by Automobiles" width="614" height="461" />[/caption]

All this talk of Quisling Hood isn't meant to be a downer, but rather and upper.

For one thing, the Forces of Darkness are receding faster than their hairlines, and the younger generation is putting on a much better showing in terms of advocacy.

However, things are not yet perfect or even good enough to recommend cycling to anyone who doesn't bleed green, is not a dare devil athlete, or is bike loving like me.

Thus, we should still know thy enemy.

How do we separate the Quisling cyclists from the real ones?

As the good book says, "You will recognize them by their fruits..." and Quislings are quite fruity. :)

http://esv.scripturetext.com/matthew/7.htm

I find that the Quisling are recognized by the following fruits (or signs):

The first sign is "motoring" which is the primary way that Quislings get around. If pressed on the matter, they make all sorts of excuses which are OK just like Ford workers driving around in Toyotas.

The second sign is "microscope" which is what Quislings put each piece of legislation, only, that will help cyclists. As I said before, there's not a bike path they hate nor a closed off, car only freeway that they don't love.

Finally, they are bossy, again to cyclists only. They write posts which ask us to be "considerate" as if we are children or something. Note, that we don't tell people who are above us to be "considerate". Actually, we don't order about anyone who's not a child or a subordinate.

If you run into someone who displays one or all of these signs bike--don't walk--away.

They will pretend to be your friend, pretend to like you then when your back is turned, they will knife you in the back, and you'll be cold and alone, riding along side of a highway--but not freeway because they oppose freeway riding, too.

Don't argue with a Quisling because they are total time-wasters.

  <title>The Cycling Environment</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/08/11/the-cycling-environment/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Often, as a cyclist, I am labeled as being an environmentalist, but for some reason, I bristle at the accusation.

Until now, I have not really examined my feelings to discover _why_ I feel this way.

Initially, it could be due to my not wanting to be labeled at all.

But it's also because these kinds of labels separates me from others. Calling me an "environmentalist" implies that the caller is NOT an environmentalist.

Motorists NEVER call one another motorists, for example, but I do it all the time because in this way I _am_ different. 

Regarding environmentalism, I am not.

Like most of my political views, my opinion is to take the middle ground in order to maximize my own happiness.

I have found the trouble (and stupidity) usually lies on the fringes of ideas. This is because humans don't operate by emotion or logic or a higher cause as much as we are run purely by habit. And being too different makes it hard to interact with others.

There's more, too, as this is a subject that I have thought deeply and hard about.

For one thing, I am not going to leave behind anyone. So there's no selfish reason for me to care about the environment because there are no children to leave the world to.

A friend of mine did point out that I still might be screwed if I get reincarnated on this planet. Since I believe all religions to be totally true, I believe in reincarnation (as well as heaven, hell, and the complete emptiness of the human mind as my brain flatlines).

On the other hand, there's little to say that my individual actions do anything to help the planet.

Thus, I have come to a rough compromise regarding the planet.

I think that it's silly to purposely trash one's planet. Thus, if there's an easy way to do so, I will be environmentally sound. This includes cloth napkins, composting, eschewing paper plates, and riding my bicycle.

On the other hand, there are some superstitious ways that I could be trying to help the environment only they don't work such as saving water to an absurd length. I don't waste water, but I don't get uptight about it, either.

I mean what do you do with someone who recycles all their aluminum cans and uses cloth diapers and at the same time pumps out ten kids and drives a Hummer?

Oh, and I'm not sure that riding a bicycle over riding a car is even more environmentally friendly and most "environmentalists" do agree with me. 

In fact, most people who call themselves environmentalists do drive cars. 

Overall, I have no problem with Hummer drivers except their ugly taste in vehicles. I mean really, if you want to look tough walk through a ghetto. Better yet, get in a fight in a ghetto and run back here in one piece. Hiding behind big sheets of metal, strangely enough, doesn't impress me.

Not that I think it's a good idea to try to look tough in the first place. My goal is to present a friendly face at the same time not come off as a total pushover.

Part of my friendliness is sharing the fun I have cycling. I believe that one of the easiest way to see if what you are doing is moral is to see how you feel when other people do it.

For example, when I am in heavy bicycle traffic, I'm very happy because I love it when other people bicycle. Thus, I feel that it's moral to bicycle.

But I don't let morality get in the way of fun!

I guess this is why I don't like the whole austerity notion of environmentalism (nor exercise) getting in the way of why I bicycle.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[If you get to have one:

You: Hello, nice to meet you, I am Fred, what is your name?

(If they choose not to talk to you.)

You: Why did you choose to open a dialog it you won't even introduce yourself? 

(If they shake your hand and introduce themselves.)

You: Would you like to pull over now or would you like to take my email address and arrange to meet latter?

(If they say yes, meet them. Listen to what they have to say, and respond with respect and logic. If you were wrong apologize. Let them know what the law is.)

(If they say "no" then ask them 

You: Why were you so eager to open a dialog with you if they didn't feel like following up on it?

If you feel the least bit uncomfortable tell them to pull over and to wait for the police. 

If they flee then get their license plate and report and "erratic" driver. If there were children let them know.

Remember to speak clearly and calmly at all times.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Mental Incapacity is Ecstasy</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This almost looks like an endorsement for brain damage or perhaps for drug usage, but I wrote it that way to question the whole idea that "ignorance is bliss".

I actually believe that the wiser someone is the happier that they are.

The funny this is that this has been disputed by many people especially by my friends whom I consider to be wiser than me!

Still, I have to say, that I have found happiness most of all through a great deal of practice and effort.

I think that the main reason that people don't tap into happiness research today as well as using the techniques that are available from ancient times is because they are either not aware of them or do not believe that they work.

Thus, I see, in a sense, that some faith is important. That is faith in ourselves and our abilities to make ourselves happier.

Today I found out some interesting things about happiness.

For one thing, I was confused by the hedonic treadmill which states that when you reach a certain level of success, you reset your mind to accommodate for it, and you are no longer happy with it.

This does apply to things like money and weather.

However, it does NOT apply to other things like relationships and hobbies in part because these things are choices and take effort.

See, knowing this, one can make choices to increase one's happiness. I am definitely focusing on my hobbies and healthy friendships with as many people as possible.

In the past, I believed that I only had so much "friendship energy", and I had to conserve for the best people in my life.

Now I just take people as they come.

Another big part of happiness is one's set point.

There is some base level of happiness (or unhappiness) in all of us. I have seen some people, like Kim in the band Matt and Kim, who smile all the time for no good reason. This has inspired me to try to more like her.

Through reading research, I learned that one's base line happiness is called the "set point" and that this can be changed through only a few ways: drugs (temporarily like ProzacTM), meditation, and cognitive therapy. The latter two are permanent that is, one's set point naturally stays higher even after you quit. Prozac is like most drugs in that it makes you feel better when you are on it, and when you aren't you're back to where you started unless you use the Prozac high to practice the latter two skills.

I do both of the latter everyday. In fact, I almost (almost!) welcome insomnia as it gives me a chance to meditate.

These days I'm doing more cognitive therapy than meditation, using my mind to try to figure out why I choose to feel the wrong ways.

All of this is knowledge and wisdom, and back when I was younger and dumber instead of working on myself, I'd lash out at the world. 

This ignorance was not blissful at all.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Clothing Laws</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/08/18/clothing-laws/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="614" caption="To me, far more scary than a female with cloth on her face..."]<img class=" " title="SUV rolling down Fairmount" src="http://i1143.photobucket.com/albums/n631/fredollinger/cimg2610.jpg" alt="SUV rolling down Fairmount" width="614" height="461" />[/caption]

I'm interested in clothing laws because they show me how little I actually understand about the human mind.

On the face of it, clothing laws seem really silly. Who is the government to tell me what cloth to cover my body with.

World history is rife with examples of silly looking clothing laws.

It was rumored that in the 1700's or so, England banned plaid in Scotland because they sought to suppress the will of the Scots.

Similarly, in France and the Netherlands, they either have banned or will ban face covering. This has been debated over grounds of suppressing Islam versus the notion of the insecurity of the state with regards to people just wandering around the streets of Paris with their faces covered by a bit of cloth and even national pride in a secular culture.

Even the United States had some kerfluffle regarding clothing laws when they tried to ban gang colored head coverings. The idiot school administration mindlessly applied the same law to a single little girl who wanted to cover her head because that's what she believed in.

As an American, I am inclined to be against all clothing laws because my mind has been marinated in the juices of the belief in maximizing individual freedom as much as possible.

On the other hand, I personally can't really get riled up about this issue. I just don't care. If someone tells me I can't wear a shorts while I ride my bicycle, it might piss me off. But overall, I am very used to being bossed around regarding my wardrobe, having gone to schools which made me wear a uniform. Also, there are job interviews where I wear what I am expected and smile about it.

This is being from an all ready "modern" country.

In other countries, usually in the Muslim world, clothing laws were seen as a way to rapidly modernize.

Smile now, but people really put a lot of stock into appearance and they respect the well dressed.

In order to be respected in the Western World, Attaturk banned the fez and head coverings. This and many other reforms has resulted in rapid modernization of Turkey after World War I to the point that during the breakup of the USSR, Turkey was able to make a serious bid to control some of the Central Asian republics through economic and cultural exchange.

You have come a long way, baby. :)

Many other countries in the Muslim world have clothing laws which either promote or restrict head coverings depending upon the leader's religious views.

To go on record, I'm against any religious persecution in the United States based upon clothing laws. We are a super-powerful country, and we need to regrow our pairs so that we can focus on bigger dangers in the world than pieces of cloth which only serve as a convenient distraction.

Fear no cloth, people.

Which finally brings me to my point.

Today while cycling I noticed how extroverted I am. Part of it is my forced extroversion because I feel like it is for my own good, happiness wise and success wise.

On the other hand, I noticed that I was the only person who was showing his face. Everyone else had...well...some sort of head covering.

It wasn't religious, unless you consider the need for speed (but I _have_ to drive) a religion. :)

But I do wonder at places like France, where driving with one's head covered is allowed, but women aren't allowed to cover their faces.

SARCASM ON

I imagine that a woman covering her head while WALKING around is more dangerous to the public than the same woman who's head is covered with tinted windows and who can literally run away at several times the speed of the fastest human alive.

SARCASM OFF

When I see inconsistencies like these, I recall the most people reason morally. This means that they come to the thing that they want (ban public displays of religion) then they justify it later with notions that sound good, but are actually total nonsense like "public safety".

Which reminds me of the notion of "noise words" which I had read about recently: words that seem to mean something, but when examined have no meaning at all. In most cases, "safety" and "terrorism" is used in this way.

For years, when someone said certain key words, a red flag went up and in a few more seconds, I could see that these people were just talking hogwash.

After all, if they get their way, they can still drive around with potential child molesters, drive bys, car bombs, and mafia style run over assasinations, but Buffy the Vampire Slayer with her cute cross necklace would be banned.

And that's the real tragedy. :)

I just finished the book<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Reluctant-Metropolis-Politics-Growth-Angeles/dp/0801865069">The Reluctant Metropolis: The Politics of Urban Growth in Los Angeles</a> this morning.

This book is indispensible for understanding Southern California including San Diego.

It focuses on bicycles not at all, but I did find that it did relate in one way.

It seems that almost all development of any kind is blocked due to a conflicting number of groups and interests including home owners, developers, business owners, environmentalists, civic boosters, and advocates for the down trodden.

This seems to lock up almost any kind of a coherent plan which makes for things to be a messy hodge podge with little actual urban development in the sense that there are tall buildings, walkable grocery stores, and so on.

On the other hand, this kind of grid lock favors a certain type of development which is sprawl. There are many reasons for this, and the book goes into great detail, but suffice it to say that it seems like when everyone wants to maximize their own personal situation with no regards to any kind of central planning, one gets a hopeless mess.

Despite this, I came away with a renewed sense of optimism because it seems that as they color everything in, there is going to be a breaking point where the only new development is going to be infilling.

Also, I feel that over time, people will get smarter.

All ready the next generation seems to be more urban focused.

Let&#039;s shut up and ride!"]<img class=" " title="People waiting to bicycle at night" src="http://i1143.photobucket.com/albums/n631/fredollinger/cimg2658.jpg" alt="People waiting to bicycle at night" width="614" height="461" />[/caption]

&nbsp;

As a response to the excellent ride, Critical Mass, there's another ride called Courteous Mass.

However, in my head, I had it mixed up and I called it Critical Manners in response to the question, "Is this critical mass."

This ride was so big that it even made it into City Beat the piece of crap "alternative" weekly that only looks good when it sits next to the "ranting blog on paper" that is the Reader. It's nice to see a photo of my friends in the paper!

They didn't like the writing, though I thought that it was fantastic. In fact, I wish that I could write like <a href="http://www.sdcitybeat.com/sandiego/article-9429-polite-pedaling.html">Alex Zaragoza.</a>

The only thing that I missed was to see Alex on a bicycle himself so he could get more of a first hand account of the ride. The whole, cycling is dangerous, or other nonsense reasons are so, so tired, and I'm sick of them so let's get over it and onto a bike!

As for me, I totally enjoyed the ride except for the speeches which dragged on a it.

At first I tried to socialize, but after I had exhausted all my listeners, I cut my losses and I started to cycle around the fountain with one other rider in the hopes of starting a "critical mass" of people so we could ride.

Instead, the other cyclist gave up and moved on leaving me to weaving in between the crowds of people waiting for the ride to start.

Finally, we were off, and it felt exactly like critical mass, cocaine in the veins.

We even bombed a hill into downtown, Laurel St, I think. But on the way down someone needed a wrench. I broke the golden rule and lent it to him.

Of course, this meant getting separated from the ride. Easy in an iPhone age, right?

No, we were at the awesome pedestrian bridge way earlier so I lead every back to backtrack.

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="614" caption="Took on Pedestrian Bridge when too early--backtracked for beer"]<img class=" " title="Pedestrian Bridge Fence" src="http://i1143.photobucket.com/albums/n631/fredollinger/cimg2656.jpg" alt="Pedestrian Bridge Fence" width="614" height="461" />[/caption]

On the way, we stopped by three stores which each failed to have beer. Finally, we found a place, and wrench guy bought me some beer as a reward. I thought that helping was its own reward, but I never turn down the chance for someone to do me a favor--it makes people feel good.

Finally, we regrouped.

At the end of the night we wound up at a strange club.

On the inside was lame-ass dancing that made me embarassed. I only dance Latin dance to a prescribed format. One day, I'll merge with the music like my friend says I should.

Finally, we were on Bic's porch sipping beer and eating carne asada fries.

We didn't steal the hot sauce, we borrowed it.

It's OK, he was LCI certified. :)

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Now is the best time to ride a bicycle in San Diego ever!

And things are only going to get better!

I don't need to enumerate all the successes; they have been told of in other places.  It's enough to say that this year things have been going better than ever for cycling in this "Finest City." :)

This goes along with what a good friend of mine, Moses, said about cycling advocacy, that we shouldn't have to argue with VC people anymore. This is because he thought that their ideas were going out of fashion.

Thanks to last week, this is totally true!

Thus, we can retire our animosity toward the Juans, Arnis, Jesses nor Kadris of the advocacy world. These people have either retired or have been retired from their positions and now can only fling shit at the rest of us from the sidelines. Well, if that's what they want to do, I think that they should be allowed to do so. I'd proudly stand by and take it if it means that they still retain their identity as advocates while having no means to make things worse in the real world.

Which leads us to the video where people throw food at Nerina Pallot:

"And so, everybody's going to war
But we don't know what we're fighting for
Don't tell me it's a worthy cause
No cause could be so worthy"

These people, instead of fighting, I think that we should thank. This is because one often defines oneself in relation to what one is not. And the twisted and contradictory ideas of VC are definitely what we were up against.

They'd pretend that everything was perfect for cycling in San Diego then whine about how unfair it is to schedule a VC demo which takes us up the measly hill of Texas Street. This street parallels the 163 and the 15 which are much easier inclines, but illegal for cycling. This is Juan's legacy, and he should be proud of it, and proud to show us how awesome it is in a real live demo. Instead, he just festers in his home in Lime Copse. :)

Which is fine. I totally get the whole loving your enemies thing especially when they can't hurt you. The more we hate, the more we waste time on trivialities. Also, the anger just isn't cool after a while. Still the jokes and cheap shots were and will continue to be fun. So we really just want to have our cake and eat it, too.

With the pro-cycling people in a ascendancy, I think we should focus on the positive and on riding  in the real world. Thus, I will try to write more about rainbows and toes in the sand while the waves laps against our bare feet and less about the idiot adherence to an outdated belief system.

I have been thinking a lot about identity lately.

I know that identity means a lot of things to a lot of people, but in this case, I was thinking specifically how identity is constructed.

That is, identity is seen by most people as a solid thing, but it's really made of pieces.

This concept may seem obvious, once stated, but it's hard to keep in mind especially when it creates conflict.

This is important to me because, as part of my program of trying to become a better person,

For example, in the book _Difficult Conversations_, they talk about how you can often find a complete conversational road block when you begin to question someone's identity.

This happens in ways that we don't always expect.

One obvious way is how, in the United States, people identify
themselves with their mode of transportation.

While having some pride in oneself is admirable, as George Carlin pointed out in one of his last interviews, one should only have pride in something that one has earned.

Also, in many cultures, to earn something means to make it with your hands or at least know how to repair it.

I have at least one friend who is mocked, not for biking, but for having a car that doesn't fit his "friend's" particular fad at this time.

Which is funny when we look at old adverts and see the old clunkers that the cool kids drove in the past.

In the future, we are going to look ridiculous as well.

Also, I have rented nice cars before, and I was embarassed at how much better people treated me because I really hadn't changed. All I had done was sign a piece of paper and hand over a piece of plastic.

I rented cars when I had a good job, and I rented cars when I was barely scrapping by and living in a ghetto.

So this ranking system seems to be pretty imprecise at best.

At the end of the day, we need to accept things as they are.

I accept the fact that people insist upon ranking one another based on reasons that elude me.

But if there ever is a time that I really need to impress foolish people, I know how.

Not that I foresee this happening any time soon.

I'm in a heavenverse where I can pretty much do what I want, and the most people I know are actually even MORE impressed that I ride a bicycle.

Of course, I find this, too, to be silly... :)

Defaced Fairy painting in Copenhagen."]<img alt="Fairy painting in CPH" src="http://i1143.photobucket.com/albums/n631/fredollinger/fairy-chp.jpg" title="Fairy in CPH" width="481" height="720" />[/caption]

Lately, I have been reading books on assertiveness; long time readers probably know that social skills are my current passion. Also, I am working on a novel which sums up my findings.

However, sometimes, as part of equanimity practice, I will actually be _less_ assertive.

For example, I usually speak up before someone cuts me in line. However, some days, ahead of time so I know it's not just me wussing out, I will decide to NOT speak up.

I'll let everyone cut me in line, and however else they want to treat me like shit. Of course, I never tell anyone.

The goal isn't to invite abuse, but rather to be OK with everything.

I have found that this type of attitude where I have the choice to speak up or not makes me less angry when I don't speak up and less scared to actually defend myself. This is because I know that when I am defending myself, I thought it through and am not just getting angry and lashing out.

On a bicycle, this means I get less angry about door zone incidents and the right hook. 

However, I still got angry recently, but this time it was at home.

A friend of mine posted on her wall about how she thought of my princess (and me) after taking a course that taught her that bicycles have the same rights and rules as automobiles. Often when people learn that they see the world differently when they encounter cyclists on the road.

Thus, I was happy, and I said so. But then someone else piped in, "But with the large mass of automobiles, the car always wins."

I stewed about that for a while. Then I realized that I can either fight back and assert myself (which I usually do) or I could decide not to let it bother me. 

I decided that I would let the motorist win. It's merely a law of nature really.

Here are a few times when motorists were the big winners against bicyclists:


<a href="http://velonews.competitor.com/2010/01/news/l-a-road-rage-doctor-gets-five-years_102274">This guy won five years.</a>

<a href="http://www.personalinjurydefenders.com/Speeding-Driver-In-Bicycle-Lane-Dies-In-Carlsbad-Solo-Car-Accident.html">Sometimes bike lanes are just for bikes. Take back the lane!</a>

Way to go big winners. 

I guess sometimes it's actually better to be a loser. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Surprise! Yet another friend of mine is leaving San Diego this one for Qatar home of Al Jazeera.

So many people have left, I'm starting to lose count.

As my princess says, "I hate how San Diego has a way of chasing people away."

Thus, with my friend going away, I have to have as much fun with him as I can.

Thus, I met him downtown once again. I also was excited to bomb down Linda Vista again.

By this time, I had mastered the secret decoder ring that would take me from Old Town to downtown.

Here's the picture taking while crossing highway five:

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="614" caption="Guess who&#039;s going to be late tonight? Not me! :)"]<img class=" " title="Traffic Congestion Highway Five" src="http://i1143.photobucket.com/albums/n631/fredollinger/cimg2679.jpg" alt="Traffic Congestion Highway Five" width="614" height="461" />[/caption]

This took me through the ghetto side of Old Town.

A bit later down the road there was a stunning view, one of the reasons I ride:

  <title>Just for Motorists: Part I</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/09/02/just-for-motorists-part-i/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This is part one of a one part series. :)

If you don't have a car, you can stop reading now. I'll wait.

OK, now that it's just motorists, I just wanted to give a few tips when driving around cyclists.

First of all there are motorists who feel that "cyclists belong on the sidewalk."

Actually, sidewalks are for pedestrians.

Cyclists belong on separated bicycle paths and cycle-tracks. But San Diego doesn't have any.

So it's NOT helpful to tell me to do things that are either dangerous (sidewalk riding) or not possible (get off the road).

Still, if you do think that cyclists don't belong on the road, and if you do think that jokes about killing cyclists are funny then just do it. Don't hesitate. Just kill me. It would be better that then spending eternity hearing the same weak jokes about "glad I didn't kill you."

Seecond, if you don't want to kill a cyclist then don't panic. Just treat us like a slow movie semi-truck, hauling around two car loads of live ammunition escorted in the front and back by a swat team.

Almost forgot to mention, the truck is driven by your grandmother and it has your kids in car seats next to her.

If you'd put your car inches away from a massive explosive truck driven by close family then do the same to me.

If you'd slow the fuck down around such a thing then show me the same courtesy. Good manners requires that we treat the weakest the same as we'd treat the strongest.

That's why the only person I'd verbally confront and challenge on the road is the biggest baddest guy. If I won't say it to him, I shouldn't say shit to anyone. Otherwise, I'm being a bully.

This cuts both ways.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Just for Motorists: Part II Double Blind</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Once again, I'd like to speak to the motorists only.

This should be easy for the car free cyclist because you are used to being shafted. :)

This post started with something a bit more artistic.

The most shocking thing about the transportation industry, the one thing that I'll probably never make peace with is how getting into a car turns my nicest friends into the most callous and sometimes even cruel people.

I don't blame the people at all because I feel that they are having normal reactions to their environment.

However, I thought it might be fun to try to dispesrse some of the alienation that comes with motoring with the art (and alienation) of digitally photographed candid shots. Let's face it, who looks good in candid photos especially in uncontrolled lighting, crappy equipment, and a total newb photographer?

To my consternation, however, I found that I could barely see the people I was photographing! Tinted windows don't help nor do the high speeds.

This started me thinking of another thread that I have which is aggressive yielding.

The purpose of agressive yielding is, of course, selfish. It is to generate some form of internal calm especially for the scofflaw motorists. Again, it's not like the motorists are doing anything deliberately wrong. I learned this when I saw a two minute video of cars crashing into trains over and over again. If motorists can't see a train complete with tracks which never move, how can they see me?

However, like everything else in this world, even agressive yielding does not bring perfect calm.

This is because motorists, too, like to agressively yield.

There are many reasons that this is infuriating, but the biggest one is WE CAN'T SEE YOUR FACE!

Yes, I can see your giant truck. It's beautiful especially the badass, "No Fear" sticker on the back. I love the skulls drawings, too.

However, if I yield by stopping at the light and gesturing wildly while smiling, please go.

I do appreciate the courtesy stop. This shows that your kind mind has not yet been mastered by the temptations toward nastiness that motoring offers you. Congrats. I acknowledge your awesomeness here, but not on the road.

This is because I CAN'T SEE YOUR FACE. This is doubly true if you spent extra time and money to tint your windows.

If you do all this, I can't see your face. I can only see some gesturing which might be flipping me off, it might be texting, it might mean mastrubation, it might mean you are gestruring for _me_ to go.

But I yielded first.

Also, sometimes, we stop for a reason, such as traffic you can't see. So trust us cyclists, please.

Sometimes we only have a limited time to get through the light so your RISKING MY ASS by trying to be a nice person.

So do the right thing, and if I try to make eye contact, through that big black barrier that you have erected between yourself and the rest of the world, and you see me stopped and gesturing, just go.

Thank-you.

  <title>Cycling Neighborhoods: Talmadge Canyon Park</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/09/07/cycling-neighborhoods-talmadge-canyon-park/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Everyday of the week, when I ride down Fairmount Street Hill into the valley, I pass very few neighborhoods because the sides of the canyon are like a sand castle.

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="614" caption="Sand castle walls of Fairmount Street Hill"]<img class=" " title="Sand castle walls of Fairmount Street Hill" src="http://i1143.photobucket.com/albums/n631/fredollinger/cimg2721.jpg" alt="Sand castle walls of Fairmount Street Hill" width="614" height="461" />[/caption]

However, after one of the first merges, there's another potential merge with people coming out of a street that I don't think too much about.

Some of the motorists, like a military dude, were really kind and made it clear that I could safely merge. Others like some lady, actually pulled out into the bicycle lane, right in front of me forcing me to pass on the left because I didn't want to rear end her.

Thus, I do think about the vehices, but only when I had to stop one day due to crap in my lane, did I actually go and explore the street which had a sign which said: Talmadge Canyon Park.

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="614" caption="Talmadge Canyon Park (sic) what a misnomer!"]<img class=" " title="Talmadge Canyon Park Sign" src="http://i1143.photobucket.com/albums/n631/fredollinger/cimg2722.jpg" alt="Talmadge Canyon Park Sign" width="614" height="461" />[/caption]

A smaller writer would mock this sign as it is totally nonsense. Talmadge is a nice neighborhood which is really quiet, and this is a neighborhood which is totally disconnected from the former. It's an oasis next to a highway and unlike the real Talmadge has zero walkability to restuarants, grocery stores, and any other amenity besides a little swimming pool.

Also, it's not a park; it's a housing development. I don't get why these assholes continue to use misnomers from the strip mall called a village to the cafe which does NOT allow you to drink coffee and read a book to the housing development called a park. It's annoying because it's confusing to me.

I felt a little like a spy going into the "park" which is not normally how I feel. Usually there's a spot where I can sit down, but this was very uninviting.

However, the people inside were really kind and I didn't see any homeless camping out; I doubt they would have lasted long in this private development disguised as a  "park."

Despite the speed limit of 55 MPH outside, inside the park it was 10. That's right 10 MPH.

In San Diego, the speed limits are often very high because people fear for their "safety" and they need good traffic through put. I guess that's just for other people's neighborhoods! :)

I could not do more than 5 MPH while climbing the hills.

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="614" caption="55 to 10 MPH!"]<img class=" " title="55 to 10 MPH!" src="http://i1143.photobucket.com/albums/n631/fredollinger/cimg2723.jpg" alt="55 to 10 MPH!" width="614" height="461" />[/caption]

This photo gives no real indication of how steep this hill really was. It was as steep as B Street. The area only went back like a tenth of a mile. Outside was a roaring death trap. Inside it was cozy and quiet.

Still, I felt it was a bit like an island prison.

When I see people living in places like this, I realize that between my mind and the residents lies this huge canyon of ideas that I struggle each day to bridge, but continue to fail at.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[As I talked about in my post on my commute, after the nasty merges on Fairmount Street Hill, there's actually a nice biking path that takes me over what would be a painful merge.

The other day when I crossed over, I saw this:

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="614" caption="A homeless person, innocently forgot it..."]<img class=" " title="Shopping Cart Trick I" src="http://i1143.photobucket.com/albums/n631/fredollinger/cimg2726.jpg" alt="Shopping Cart blocking bike lane" width="614" height="461" />[/caption]

This is hard to see in the photo, but this comes out of no where if you are going down the hill because the path is obscured by shrubs.

No problem, people make mistakes. They didn't place this in the perfect spot for someone to run into it.

This wasn't too bad for me, either, because I ride really slow. I'd be more in trouble had I been a racer.

Still, I dumped it down a hill. This was a bit tough because many parts of the hill would have put this in the road. I finally found a spot where it would rest, safe, away from cars and bicyles alike.

The next day, while going down the hill, what did I see?

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="614" caption="Is this deliberate? Not really sure..."]<img class=" " title="Shopping Cart II" src="http://i1143.photobucket.com/albums/n631/fredollinger/cimg2727.jpg" alt="Shopping Cart in the bike path again" width="614" height="461" />[/caption]

The shopping cart was in exactly the same spot.

At this point, I got really pissed off, and I dumped the shopping cart over a fence where it rests to this very day.

Still, I am a bit bemused to think that this was a plot to hurt cyclists. If it was, it was very weak and lame.

I don't really think so, but people who are less fanatical about cycling say that it looks like it is.

Still, if this is the most exciting part of my commute, my life is good. :)

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Apparently, there's a trend to naming one's bicycle.

I actually have a really hard time with that. I mean, if you want to name your bicycle, what do I care?

On the other hand, I don't know the purpose of this. I have a really hard time coming up with names for my computers. So the less things I have to name the better. 

However, I finally figured out a name for my bicycle. Of course, instead of being simple, I decided for a polymorphic name.

Thus, you can insert the name of the biggest, baddest, worst dictator, killer, or devil. These things change from week to week and so will my bicycle name.

Why the hell would I connect something so horrible to something that I am so attached to?

Probably because some people level the same hatred towards bicycles that they will normally direct towards murderous dictators.

The funniest thing about this bile is when it comes to spending on bicycles. As I pointed out before, it's almost zip.

Whenever someone wants to spend a dime on cycling, a tiny sliver of motorists act as if we are committing genocide or something.

As a good friend said, "cycling is a very humble form of transportation."

The funny thing about the complaints about cycling infrastructure is that the same motorists who whine that we should get in the bike lane are opposed to building them.

The same ones who complain about "being forced to cycle" want to force everyone to drive.

The same people who complain about too much traffic and high gas prices complain about those who don't contribute to these things.

And, I am still waiting, for the guy who got the last parking spot in a lot to thank me, while I lock my bike, for keeping that spot open for him.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_762" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Best food in San Diego"]<a href="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/cimg2696.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-762" title="Miho Gastrotruck" src="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/cimg2696.jpg?w=300" alt="Miho Gastrotruck (food truck)" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]

&nbsp;

One of the differences between San Diego and Philly is that Philadelphia had a great variety of food, but the best food was found in fine dining, like you'd expect.

San Diego has some really good food, too, but the BEST food in the city can often (not always) be found from a truck.

Miho Gastrotruck is one such example. The prices are really fair for what you get.

Usually the trucks park outside of bars which allow you to bring the food in. Some even give you drink tickets!

If you see one of these trucks, and you have time, do NOT pass it up.

In other news, last weekend, there was supposed to be a ride to Mission Brewery which I often pass on my bombing down Linda Vista Hill posts.

Last Friday, we were supposed to go there (I thought) so I showed up there.

Of course, there were two <a href="http://urbanistguide.com/blog/Urban-Dish-Mission-Brewery-San-Diego-Restaurant.aspx">Mission Breweries!</a>

The other one is on <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/mission-brewery-san-diego">L and 12th!</a>
&nbsp;
I told that to my friend, who's a vegan, and he said getting brew pubs mixed up shows how amazing of a beer town this is when there are so many places that brew that you get them mixed up! It's like having so many vegan options in SD that  like you get names of the vegan cup cake places mixed up.

Good point.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[In order to better have empathy for motorists, I decided to try to imagine what it would be like to be one!

I'm going to rent a car on weekends and tool around, but I'm going to pretend, for love's sake, to commute full time by auto.

Furthermore, I'm going to ignore the concerns of real full time motorists.

Most of you know why I would do this.

Plus comedy is a harsh mistress.

  <title>Humility and Equanimity</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/09/20/humility-and-equanimity/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[One of my favorite quotes on cycling is that "cycling is a very humble way to travel."

I have been running this thought through my head for a while because I've been working on equanimity, and I think that humility practice could help with that.

The hallmark of an equanamous person is that they radiate calm at all times. This really isn't something that you can force because if you bottle up your emotions, they can come out later even worse that before. 

However, this danger isn't going to stop me from practicing this skill. 

One way that I am practicing is trying to see where I get out of balance, either too happy or too upset, and to see what happened just before.

I noticed that one of the most common triggers is attacks on my person or identity. That is, someone buzzed me (threated my body with harm). Or they cut me off, I believed I had the right of way. Or they put forth an idea that I disagree with.

I realize that if I had less of an attatchment to my self and was thus more humble, I could be more equanamous.

Thus, each time I get upset, I'm looking to see what sort of belief about myself got me to feel how I felt.

I have been really been enjoying this practice, but those who know me, realize that I have a long, long way to go.

One other thing about equanimity, is that I can't talk about it for long without thinking about my princess who, to me, is the paragon of calm. She is undertaking some difficult advocacy where she's coming into contact with people who are abrasive and argumentative. It is their nature to throw sand in your eye, and to confuse you.

After a while, you start to hate them and everything that they stand for. This is most unhelpful in advocacy where one needs a calm head, and a commitment to one's principles.

Princess has stuck to this while I have lost my head; she has pulled me back to where I need to be, and I am grateful for this.]]></content:encoded>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm going to talk about something that I know almost nothing about and that's road engineering.

I was thinking about it this morning, and I realized that it seems to be the only field where the engineers dictate the terms.

It's as if engineering took over marketing and management. The even made themselves sole consumers of the product.

They have two chief tools of control: their titles and safety.

As for safety, who isn't for it? Unless they are against it.

I think that if we have two situations, and they are totally the same except one is safer, we should take the safer alternative.

Unforutately few situations are so simplistic, and in the real world, we all make trade-offs regarding safety, daily. Sometimes we have to be risky to be safe.

This means that we must leave the house and meet people. This gives us excercise which protects us from chronic disease and our friends protect us from depression and other problems. So it's not a black and white thing otherwise we'd seal ourselves off in caves. 

Which isn't a bad idea for some people. :)

Besides safety there are titles which tell us, "I know best. How dare you question me."

I find this attitude to be silly.

Imagine the engineers at Apple when they first heard they were going to make a music player that had a library of music, but you could put it into your pocket!

Absurd! It can never be done. Nobody wants one. The parts aren't available. And so on.

No, the people with these attitudes are in the food lines now.

The others did the impossible and made the product.

I'm in the same boat at work. I have to design this product that many people say is overly ambitious. All of us are working as hard as we can on it instead of whining that it can't be done and that the compeditor has all ready made a better product so let's just use that.

Likewise, when people are told that they want separate infrastrure, and they want it to be safe, the good engineers of the world are working hard to make that dream happen.

There's more than one way to skin and cat, and there's more than one way to design a road.

I'm just happy to be alive in a time when it looks like everyone is putting out their own iPod styles of roads. They are being brave and bold and experimenting.

We will have some set backs just like we did with the rocket program. But when the first rocket the US made exploded on the platform, we didn't decide that the Russians were all ready in space and that nobody needed to go to the moon anyway.

We got back onto our feet and built the rocket of our dreams. 

So everytime someone says that bike infrastructure is bad for some reason or another, recall the iPod engineers and think about the US putting the flag on the moon.

Just like we did with the space program and portable music players, the we can lead the world in bike infrastructure.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>The Science of Cycling</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This title is rather a tease because although I have years of science both in University and in the field, I don't think that science belongs in cycling.

That's not totally true, either. I do think that science--especially hard science--has its place in cycling, but it's a limited one.

To paraphrase one of my inspirations, the environment affects how we cycle. It's more than just velocities and distances. Aside from muscle memory and reflexes, we also use more subtle cues to decide how to ride.

Or should I say that subtle cues influence us more than most of us would like to admit. 

A good example of this is how differently people treat me on Fairmount Road (the highway) depending on which merge I'm at.

Pretty much the same people drive the whole stretch of it--you can't get off--so the sample is pretty even. But how I am treated differs greatly depending on if I am merging onto Fairmount from Camino De La Reina or whether I am passing another merge further down.

Why are people nice in one case and not in another? The only thing that differs is subtle cues in the road. 

Few of these cues will show up on a blueprint for a road. And I if there's a way to determine, mathematically, how people are going to respond to a certain road stimulus, I am unfamiliar with it.

This is why, when discussing my experiences, I use feeling based and gut based terms. In fact, sometimes when I ride, I don't think at all, I rely on instinct; I'm an unthinking cyclist. I feel that when I think the least, I'm on my cycling game the most.

Probably better than being an uncycling thinker... :)]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Apparently, "Ride of the Valkeries" by Wagner is the #1 song to cause accidents. :)

I do agree about accidents. Right before almost any accident, I somehow lose my emotional grip.

This is why I suggest some kind of mindfulness during cycling.

I hear ppl say they drove home and don't recall it. I never biked somewhere and forgot about it immediately. Not once.

I'd be scared if that happened.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Like Not Equals</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Before I write my actual post, I'd like to share this link:

<a href="http://minusonemoose.wordpress.com/2011/09/22/meditation-flash-mob-for-international-day-of-peace/">Mediation Flash Mob</a>

I usually think that flash mobs are kind of dumb, and now due to my philly connections, pretty scary.

But a spontaneous group meditation is awesome. I can't imagine how much better the energy was while that was going on.

Meditation has such a great effect on the mind.

Speaking of the mind, I've been thinking about how the human mind takes real world experiences and turns them into meaning through mental filters.

This isn't a really sinister thing, it's how higher level intelligence deals with the world, and it is responsible for all of our best art, philosophy, and culture.

However, when we are not aware of the process, we can sometimes substitute what we want with what we think we want. I think that this happens most often with modern inventions such as modern transportation because our minds did not evolve to solve these problems.

An example is high speed driving. People really want to drive fast. But they don't--well some do, but they are in NASCAR.

When you talk to people, they really want two things more than speed which are being on time and safety.

With all the obsession with safety, from the demonization of walking in the street (jaywalking) to the hour long rants based upon the seconds lost passing cyclists, you'd think that most would favor lower speed limits.

But they don't because they fear not being on time. And loss of control is as large of a fear as is safety.

But the real problem isn't speed nor safety, but rather getting somewhere on time. Thus, if we figured out ways to get people places faster while driving slower, it would be a win/win.

Parking is another huge obsession for many people, and rightly so. If you can't park reasonably close to something then you can't get there at all and that reduces choices and increases frustration. But again, the point is to get there and not find storage for your vehicle. Most people in San Diego have free parking at home all ready.

Another example is "taking the lane" or driving in traffic. The real concern is getting places "comfortably and safely" rather than mixing it up with traffic.

Only a lunatic would assert that the zenith of "safety" is getting close to fast moving obstacles which would kill you with a minutes of distraction. On the road, we all are, motorists, pedestrians, and pogo sticks, are all a single text message away from death.

So again, the real issue is not "taking the lane" but fuzzer feeling terms as well as "the ability to choose my own route."

This whole confusion of what people want is referred to in nursing theory as having an "unmet need."

Patients aren't always able to verbalize what they _really_ need so it's the nurses (and advocates) job to figure out what that is and to satisfy people's real, emotional needs.

Even some bully trying to dominate a conversation is really just someone who is struggling to be heard and understood.

The problem is that when people latch onto the idea that they _think_ will solve their problems to the detriment to themselves and everyone else.

The only ways to stop them are amazing rhetorical skills and the judicious use of physical force. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Touching Taboos</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/09/26/touching-taboos/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Like everywhere else, there are topics that are taboo in the bicycle world.

Luckily, many of them are actually more harmless than they sound.

One of them is sidewalk riding.

In the past, I have freely and gleefully admitted that I had broken this (ever so minor) taboo of riding styles.

While I think that in many cases there are better riding styles, people usually ride in the way that makes them feel the most comfortable and safe. I fully support people's rights to think for themselves and to make their own decisions.

Sadly, this is often not the case in the cycling world. Much of the cycling literature is littered with stern "thou shall nots". Where's the fun in that?

Thus, I think that riding instructions should be like condoms. Instead of telling people not to sidewalk ride, and have them do it anyway and get hurt, why not give them advice that will protect them?

I feel sidewalk riding and salmoning are phases that most of us went through on our way to riding proficiency.

Thus, I have started a book which will fill in the gaps that other "safety" courses leave out: how to ride more safely on the sidewalk, how to use cycle trakcks, and most of all how to have fun!

Since the book is to help people, I'm going to make it available as I write it here:

  <title>Don't Fear the Newbie!</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[It has been brought to my attention that there is a small number of people in the cycling world who, instead of embracing the newbie cyclist will actually try to drive them away.

I'm going to give some two cents to the expert and newbie alike:

Experts:

1. Don't scare them away!

2. Seriously, if it's a lady, don't harass her.

3. Don't fear newbies. They tend to be more law abiding than so-called "experts".

4. Everyone was a newbie, even you so treat them like you like to be treated.

5. Answer questions in a manner that's honest, but not abasive and overly judgemental and opinionated. Plus, KEEP IT SHORT.

6. Otherwise, don't give advice. Don't tell them that they are "doing it wrong". A few years ago, you were doing it wrong. Maybe you are still doing it wrong.

7. Try to learn from the newbie.

Newbie:

1. Welcome.

2. Don't listen to people on mailing lists unless they are nice. But they are mostly assholes.

3. Wear what you want, including a helmet.



4. Don't let people bother you. Don't let so-called experts talk at you, even me. Just walk away when you are tired of them.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree, biking is very simple.  Many people try to over complicate it with special equipment or special rules, but it is not much different than walking and the rules of the road or no different than driving.

I work at an outdoors store and find that newbies come in thinking that they need $100 shoes with special $100 pedals in order to ride thier bike up a hill or around the nieborhood.  I tell them that as they pursue cycling as a sport they may find the fancy pedals helpful, but that they don't need them.  In fact they don't give them more efficiency or power, and if they are not used to them they might fall over.  

Maybe I am just another so called expert, but my message is that cycling is fundamentally simple and easy, and it is often our fears that make us think that we need lots of different things in order to ride a bike.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This post is mainly due to fallout of a recent battle that my princess has been fighting.

Long time readers might know that she, and every other transportation advocate who was born after the Led Zepplin broke up, has to battle idiotic killjoys. Yes, we're back to talking about our good neighbors, the Quislings, the motorists in lycra. :)

Anyway, the current hubub is about whether the prophet has proven once and forever that playing in traffic is safer than cycling in a place that was, well, designed, by experts, for cycling.

Since he likes to call everyone else who disagrees with him "unscientific", let's perform a real world, empirical study to see how well this dogma holds water.

Let's call it the Intersection Cage Fight!

In one corner, we have 54th and Univeristy in San Diego, the biggest, baddest intersection in the city. If all the intersections in the city were in the same movie, 54th would be the killer as it has the highest body count.

Recently, we were told, however, that the number of deaths were not important, but rather what mattered was our particular fear of the intersection. This kind of talk reminds me of John Kreese, leader of Cobra Kai in the Karate Kid.

I guess someone has to stand up for the bad guys. :)

The good one of this match is, well, pick  
<a href="http://bikeportland.org/2011/01/26/portland-had-zero-bike-fatalities-in-2010-again-46743">any single intersection</a> in Portland Oregan.

That is because there were zero fatalities last year.

A scientific and facts based approach would be to ask what they did right and what they did wrong.

A stupid and egotistical approach would be to assert that we are so radically different of a civization that nothing there applies here, and anyway, the number of deaths is OK as long as we can cling to our outdated belief system.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I had a long slow leak all week. I had to blow up tire every morning before work and every evening.

Nothing worked. I couldn't find it. Changing the tube didn't help.

Finally, I found out that the problem is a bad tire, the wire on the edge actually cut my inner tubes.

So I went to the bike shop this morning. Total cost was $40.

Compared w/ driving a U-Haul where I had to put in $40 every few hours, $40 dollars every six months is pocket change.

Yet many seem to think that my $1000 bicycle is too expensive because I could get a car for less.

Not really. I mean I could have a hunk of steel that's car shaped, but could I keep it running for more than 5 minutes w/o spending thousands more?

No. I did that before. Heck, I paid $700 for insurance alone for a year for a car I didn't even drive!

That much for something that gets me around for YEARS is a total bargain.

So I don't get it. Bikes are too expense, I guess.

Anyway, fixed my tire; it looks great. 

As per Oprah's advice, I treated my despair wit food. :)

Now I'm off for a fun ride: to work.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Bike Repair Attitude</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I have had a few bicycle problems lately, but I didn't let it get me down.

Since a bicycle is so simple, there's only a few things that can go wrong with it, and unlike my last bike, the frame didn't crack in half yet. :)

Thus, I know that the problems (and money loss) will end soon.

Currently, I'm dealing with brake problems. Or rather, I just fixed them again, and they should be good for another few months at least.

Today, the repairs were more pleasant that most. I realize that the main reason that I didn't like repairs, and I wasn't good at them was because of my poor attitude.

Thus, I'd like to share what I learned about this.

1. I don't have time to fix my bicycle. In that case, you're going to have to make time. I am currently setting aside ample time to get the job done, and I'm less stressed.

Think about it, even if you took your bike to the shop or even just bought a new bike each time there was a problem, this would take time. In fact, fixing your bike yourself is the most time saving way to go.

If you had a car, you'd have to maintain it yourself or pay for it to have it fixed. Those who say that they just have their XXX take care of it...you'll pay for that, too. :)

2. I'm not good with tools and/or bikes are too hard to fix.

Nobody started out good with tools. 

I can fix most things on my own bicycle, but I didn't start out that way. Repairs are still more of a pain in my ass than fun unlike some of my friends.

I started out small: I had a done flats in my first week of riding. This was before I learned to check for wire embedded in your tire before fixing the flat. :)

If you have small successes, you can always grow from there. 

There are excellent resources in San Diego, for free. For example, the Bike Kitchen in at the City Heights Farmer's Market. They helped me do some things I did not know how to do at the time such as replace my rear cassette.

3. I'm too good to fix a bike and/or bike repair is demeaning.

This is true, now more than ever because fame for doing nothing is more admired than anything else other than, perhaps, being rich for doing nothing. 

Not that there's anything wrong with that. My ban on hating extends to the reality tv stars. :)

In some societies skills are most admired. I, personally, hold people who are skilled at anything to be in high regard.

In fact, I wouldn't be with my princess if she were the kind who tried to use her sex as an excuse to be incompetant. I am shocked that some dudes find incompetance sexy, but each to their own.

If we think about skills, it's obviously better to have more than less skill. Jordan's face wouldn't be on shoes if he were not very skilled.

Plus, what's more demeaning, getting stuck in the middle of nowhere or fixing your own bike?

I think that roadside bike repair is kind of badass actually, especially when you need to improvise like turn a geared bike into a temporary single speed just to get home. :)

I'll leave with a final note from F.R.I.

The dudes always want to play hero to the damsel in distress with their tools.

There's certainly not anything wrong with helping people. I offer my tools to anyone who's stuck on the side of the road. However, you need to take a step back to realize a few things.

First of all, does she want to be helped? If you are forcing help on someone is it help? What kind of message is this "help" sending? Sometimes, if you offer help too aggressively without LISTENING to what the lady wants, you may be saying, "You can't fix a bike because you a woman."

This is nonsense because my princess is better at bike repair than I am.

Finally, if you are going to "help" out the ladies, you better be damned sure you are better at it than her. There's nothing more frustrating than to be "helped" by someone who has no clue on what they are doing.

I know more than one woman who can fix a flat in 11 minutes. Can you?]]></content:encoded>

  <title>"Taking the lane!" Considered Harmful</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/10/05/taking-the-lane-considered-harmful/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[First we'll link to <a href="http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/boilerplate-legal-disclaimer/">boilerplate legal disclaimer.</a>

It's common in the cycling world to "take the lane" as some kind of voodoo safety remedy. In fact, there's a whole school of thought who thinks that this is the "safest place for a cyclist."

And it is...

...if you consider "safest place" the same as "most likely to get rear ended."

Just thinking about it logically says that you are most likely to be rear-ended if you are in the whole lane. The more effort a motorist has to put forth to get around you, the more likely they are going to fail to do so. This is especially true with iPhones, texting, and the myriad of other driver distractions available today.

Yeah, right, but if you are in the middle of the lane, you are most visible, and less likely to be hit. Right? Also, intersections are more dangerous if you don't take the lane. Plus there's the danger of dooring.

Proponants of "taking the lane" like to talk endless about intersections. In fact, they misleadingly conflate problems with intersections with bike lane injuries while negleting to include all the times that cyclists are rear ended.

I believe that intersections are different than rear-ending problems. Common sense says that you can be hit no matter what position you are in an intersection. 

There have been no studies that show that riding in the middle of the lane makes you less likely to be hit in an intersection than in any other position. One may argue that the main factor that makes going through an intersection safe are paying attention to all vehicles entering the intersection. This is best done when going at a slow speed.

Thus, we need to break things out regarding cyclist's awareness, speed, lane position, AND luck of the draw. Since this study has not been done, it's impossible to determine the role that lane position plays in accidents in intersections.

Of course, there is the classic "right hook", but again, this accident is most often prevented by awareness by motorists and cyclists.

To put it another way, with cyclists and motorists unaware, a collision between the two is inevitable _despite lane position_. On the other hand, if cyclists and motorists are 100% aware of one another, lane position will not cause a collision. The real world is a muddy mix of all these factors.

Dooring is another matter. "Don't ride in the door zone" is a mantra. However, how true is this? Where is a scientific study that shows that getting hit by a relatively light car door is worse than being rearended by an SUV?

The objection: "But a door pushes you into traffic."

Sure it does. Once you get doored into traffic, you get rearended which is exactly why I say NOT to ride in the middle of the lane.

Objection: "Getting rear-ended is not likely if you practice 'effective cycling'." 

This is a totally dogmatic argument with no basis in reality.

"According to the National Safety Council, over 2.5 million rear end collisions are reported every year, making them the most common type of automobile accident " <a href="http://www.auto-accident-resource.com/statistics.html">Source.</a>

This is for the much more more visible motor vehicle. If this many motor vehicles, by percentage*, are rear-ended how more likely are bicycles to be rear ended?

It's hard to say because we don't have the stats in the US. However, it's common sense that the smaller and less visible you are the more likely you are to be hit. 

Forget about the silly looking neon and flashing lights. Many of those who get rear-ended in San Diego county are lit up like Christmas trees. In fact, we'll deal with that topic in another post called "Ninjas are safer on bikes".

Now we consider dooring. How often to people die due to it?

Hard to say because there is no definitive study on it. However, an older study says that it almost never happens:

..."Cyclist strikes open door on driver's side of parked car," contain[ed] 5.3 percent of all accidents. This type accounted for only 0.8 percent of all accidents in the Cross study..."

<a href="http://www.bikexprt.com/bikepol/facil/lanes/dooring.htm">Source is the "Cross Study."</a>

I'm too lazy to look up whether this study is the same one that "lane taking" advocates use to "prove" that bike lanes are dangerous.

Obviously, they are not.

Summary:

Bike lanes don't cause drivers not to see you, riding too fast and not paying attention (on motorists _and_ cyclists parts) does.

Dooring is a negligible risk. Nearly everyone rides in the door zones on my commute. Nobody EVER took the lane EVER. NEVER. Yet dooring almost never happens, and when it does it's not often fatal.

Taking the lane exposes a cyclist to a risk that if they were protected by NOT riding in the middle of the road, they would avoid. 

Riding in the middle of the lane makes cycling more dangerous than motoring (because of less protection for the cyclist). 

Yet, with ZERO studies and ZERO scientific backing, many Quisling advocates urge for riding in the middle of the lane. They also take this religious belief to deny cyclists their right to ride in as much comfort as motorists.

Also, there's not much talk about responsibilty NOT to door cyclists. The same training and laws that protect us from getting rear-ended deliberately make it a legal necessity for motorists to LOOK before they open the door. Failure to do so puts someone in a legal liability. Most motorists do not text while opening doors (unlike normal driving). Also, door openings are infrequent while traffic is usually constant.

Conclusion:

How you ride is up to you.

More research is needed. It's safe to say that we don't know what the best answer is so a mixed style is probably best.

For example, if there is really slow traffic and many people are in and out of their cars, I'll take the lane. If I am going down hill, I always take the lane.

When going up a very steep hill, I ride in the door zone.

I have been hit by doors two times, and I didn't sustain any injury at all. Had I been rear-ended by a motor vehicle going at 50 MPH (routine on most roads I'm forced to ride on), I doubt I'd live to bitch about it.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Libertarian Case of Bicycle Lanes</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[WARNING: This is a political rant. Thus it was fun to write.

All views are held be me. Any attempt to argue will make me dig my trench a little deeper...

Like all belief systems, libertarianism has some good ideas and some bad ideas.

One of the bad ideas is that they do what Buddhists call "clinging to views". In this case, they think that they have the Truth and thus all who disagree are idiots.

Anyone who ordered pizza with more than two geniuses will realize that even really smart people disagree on the most trivial things. Anchovies are totally awesome people. :)

The good "idea" of libertarianism is freedom.

This basically depends upon what the speaker wants as libertarians tend to be highly selfish.

This leads me to their second idea which I agree with which is selfishness as I am selfish, too. :)

Typical libertarians, though, differ from me in many ways. After 911, they were fearful so they wanted Big Daddy Govt to go to war for them and for everyone to pay for it.

They drive cars so they want free roads and parking paid for by all of us.

They are usually successful with stocks so they are in favor of corporate subsidies.

They do not ride bicycles too often, though so they do not think that bike infrastructure is necessary.

Yes, there's a <a href="http://bicyclesafe.com/eci.html">whole moronic notion</a> that cyclists don't need anything from the government. Some even go as far as to say that bike lanes are "hand outs" and "special favors". 

Well, I think that they should shut-up because why would I refuse a "special favor"?

It's a typical double standard of selfish people to hold everyone else to a bizzare level of generosity.  

But they had me at "freedom" and "selfish" so let's just stop there.

I'd say right now that, overall, the government made things harder for cyclists, and that anything that they build right now is not a "special favor", but rather it's payback of what they had taken from us from the start.

For example, every freeway is a barrier to cyclists. Do we have the same mobility now that they are built? No. What did they do to rectify this? Nothing.

Everytime a road is widened, the speed is higher and less people bike.

Taking the lane is idiotic and dangerous which is why nobody does it. Plus, it does not pass the hamburger test. 

In the UK, the top meat inspector said that beef is safe to eat. A reporter shoved a burger in his face and asked him to feed it to his seven year old child. He refused. 

Actions speak louder than words. Plus, I'm a bit slow on readig comp, I learn by watching others and by doing.

When I get two VC folks to have their kids protect me in front and in back on my daily commute, I will believe them. Otherwise, it's all words on a computer screen.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Riding Sick</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Before I start, I'd like to say that over 30 years of SD cycling has been based upon this study:

<a href="http://ntl.bts.gov/lib/25000/25400/25439/DOT-HS-803-315.pdf">Cross Study Part 2: WARNING BIG PDF</a>

If you carefully read the study as well as the "safety" literature, you'll find a lot of cool findings that will make you feel like Columbo or something. But your not because other people beat you to the punch. Still, a good read if you are stuck on a desert island and the other person there is not very attractive. :)

One of my biggest fears on cycling is actually getting stuck somewhere when I'm too sick to ride home.

Note, that this has never happened. The worse I felt was after surgery, and I always had a ride home.

Sometimes when I feel a bit sick in the morning, I'll elect to stay home even though I tell myself that if I could drive to work, I'd go. Hard to say whether this is totally true, though.

Then, this morning, I recalled that Friday evening in South Philly. It was pretty chilly, and I was sick as a dog. A whole weekend to recover right? I mean, it was dark all ready, too.

No, princess wanted me to help her get some "free" mirror. Ug.

Of course, since we walked everywhere this meant several blocks of walking to the house, getting the mirror--which was pretty nice, but heavy--and walking home with it.

As I walked home, I got hotter and hotter, despite the cold. So then I had sweat AND chilly air. God, I love East Coast winters!

When I got home, I found that I could breathe better. I recovered, the next day, faster than I thought possible.

I figured that perhaps the excercise actually did me good especially being out of breathe which got air into my lower lungs. Nurses often do the same thing with a cheap plastic gadget which usually gets taken straight from the storage room to the meal try to the trash. 

Not many people want to blow into a piece of plastic and watch a little ball move up and down. :)

This morning, I had those two flashbacks, and I decided to ride to work.

Despite being "off wheels" for only three days, riding was so fun. It was like seeing an old friend again!

The whole ride was a total joy.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Mean Streets Page</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/10/11/mean-streets-page/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[As you probably know, <a href="http://www.commutebybike.com/2008/10/01/california-passes-complete-streets/">complete streets</a> passed a few years ago.

However, cyclists realize that stats and standards which have been created by motorists do not make truly "complete streets". I mean these are the people who's transportation system kills more people than any other means of getting around. Heck, they kill more Americans than terrorists and wars combined!

Thus, we need some better standard to what a complete street really is. Something softer and more human is in order.

I'm currently working on a page about mean streets. I'm going to make it a page and not a post because I need something a bit more permanant, and yet something that will be updated just like my badass Quisling page is.

Today, I started my<a href="http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/complete-streets/">Complete streets page</a>.

Ultimately, there are going to be at least two broad categories:

1. Things in instrinsic to the street

2. Cyclists reaction to #1

For now, I'm going to just list everything:

1. Do not need to wear flashing lights nor yellow vests to be safe. :)

2. Do not need to "sprint", EVER, to feel safe. You can go at your own speed and feel fine. For me this is sub-eight miles an hour.

3. Feel OK about having a 7 year old to ride with you.

I'm sure that there are many other ideas, but I'm a bit bored of this now so I'll come back to it later.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Are All Those Extra Pounds Putting You At Risk For Diabetes?</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I got the subject line as an email today, and I was thinking, "Is my health insurance company calling me a fatass?"

Not that it bothers me. For mergegue, you need some kind of ass for your information Kaiser. Also, who the F would name their insurance company after the German leader who lead the country to total failure in WWI, the factor which lead up to Hitler.

I can see the ads now, "We're not Hitler, we're the dude before him!" :)

This leads me to the actual point of this post which is one of the biggest negative and wrong stereotypes about cyclists is that they lack a sense of humor.

Sure, there are tons of humorless assholes in our world, but they are there to MAKE FUN OF. :)

I know what you are thinking, and you are wrong: Why do they not laugh at my jokes.

If it's the joke that I call the ONE JOKE then the reason is because it's more stale than Red Skelton. We've heard it.

Also, because it's doesn't follow proper humor protocol. Jay Leno once said that he wants nothing to do with humor that mocks the poor and powerless because why kick someone when they are down? He is aware the the notion of "superiority" based humor, but he is above that kind of lame ass stuff. 

Just think, who's funner Ann Coulter and Rush Limbagh or every other comedian on the planet. Most of us like the later especially cyclists.

So if you are going to tell a joke, make it really original.

Can you mock cyclists? I don't know, can you make fun of your own sister? What about other people making fun of her?

The fact is that I love cycling humor so much, that I think that <a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/">a cycling humor blog</a> is one of the funniest blogs ever.

So please, please, mock and tease me. I love the attention. Just put a little effort and originality into the jokes.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Regular cyclists may be able to relate to this bizarre problem: we can't really talk too much about cycling to non-cycling friends.

Aside from the notion of trying to avoid topics that my listeners can't relate to, I also try to avoid talking about cycling because many of my motorist friends have this guilty look on their face.

Ug, it's a conversation, not a guilt trip.

What's worse is that often people ask me how the cycling is.

The only worse thing than talking to non-cyclists about cycling is talking to actual cyclists about cycling.

We have all read the same books such as _Traffic_ by Tom Vanderbuilt, so there's nothing new to be said unless you do tons of research like my princess. :)

However, there is on crowd pleaser and that's VC cyclists.

I never get sick of the look of doubt, surprise, then horror when I relate the damage to cycling that VC Quislings have done to San Diego and beyond. 

Despite the fact that most of us know that we live in a representative republic, most people don't realize the huge relationship there is between the most vocal advocates and our built environment.

Most people seem to think that the city is a static thing which was built a long time ago by more intelligent aliens and that it will never change again.

The reality is that the environment is an ever shifting, ever plastic thing, and we all have far more control over it than we believe.

I think that we don't like to admit this because doing so makes us more responsible to how things are going now, and that's scary for most.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Feeling Good About Cycling</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I know I mentioned the wonderful book _Feeling Good_, and I'll mention it again because I read a page or two daily to keep the brain gremlins away.

On page 43, there's a great gem: a list of mental distortions.

Since my mind is distorted with bizzaro ideas from Ye Olde England and Lime Copse, here's my take:

1. All or nothing thinking:

Either bike infrastructure is totally safe in every way or it is a "liability" that ought not to be built.

2. Overgeneralization:

Once upon a time, motorists, understandably annoyed with racers fooling around in their roads while they tried to rush all their wives to give birth, designed a bike path to make traffic move faster. Now all bike path planners are "anti-cyclist" trying to force us off the road.

3. Disqualifying the postitive:

Despite the safety rating of infra-structure heavy cities as being three times San Diego, we still don't want infra-structure because--[fill in the blanks. I'm not going to do this all myself, people.]

4. Binocular trick:

Each time a VC rider gets rear-ended on a VC road, that's a fluke or due to his own mistake (microscope).

At the same time, each time someone scrapes a knee on a bike path or bumps a pedestrian, we declare the bike path to be a HAZARD to be avoided. (Telescope).

5. Should statements:

These result in guilt, anger, frustration, and resentment: a whole grab bag of good will!

These include statements such as ought:

A cyclist ought to wear a helmet.

And should:

Cyclists should ride on the right side of the road. They should also dress like the love child of a canary and a number 5 highlighter.

6. Labeling:

You are an incompetent cyclist. You are an unthinking cyclist. You are superstitious.

7. Personalization: You see yourself as responsible for events that you are not responsible for:

You're riding on OUR bike paths. 

The take home message is that mental distortions are easy to do and lots of fun.

The challenge for you is to do as many as possible at a single time.

Collect them all!

Note Dr. Burns is NOT paying me to promote his book, but I wish he was!]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Me Generation</title>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Note, though I tried, I couldn't remotely relate this post to cycling. 

Not sorry about this.

Recently, at the library, I bought a book for the dollar. It's called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Generation-Americans-Confident-Assertive-Entitled--/dp/0743276981/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1319163600&amp;sr=8-1">Generation Me</a>

Don't let the slutty cover fool you; the rest of the book isn't titillating.

It is illuminating. 

While reading it, I felt like a fish who was made aware of water for the first time. That is, our culture is so permeated with self-centeredness that we don't even notice it.

Now, whenever I hear myself saying certain phrases, I cringe, such as "whatever makes you happy."

For a long time, I knew the whole, follow your dreams, pap was overrated, but now I know more about why this is so.

Even the book, _Feeling Good_, as good as it is, in some way falls victim to the whole self-fulfillment problem.

I say it's a problem because too much emphasis on the self can lead to depression. Just listen to a depressed person talk, everything is about him.

Contrast this to a giving and caring person who doesn't seem to notice their own problems so much because they are focused on helping others.

Yet, these ideas go unquestioned.

And I see this everywhere. It's all me, me, me.

I'm totally not above any of this.

Some examples include a time at a Buddhist statue store where the owner was trying to explain the reason that the Chinese had made a certain statue and the girl interrupted with: "it means anything you want it to mean?" 

Wow, historical facts are not up to interpretation which always flows through one's own personal opinion.

At a history teacher meeting (I was there by accident), I heard them call research papers, I-search papers, because the students couldn't write two sentences, even about the distant past, without filtering it through their own personal life.

I guess this explains why people have such a hard time listening to anything, and they constantly interrupt with irrelevant details about their personal life.  

It also explains why people are so eager to spill all their own darkest personal trauma at me which really pisses me off because I'm a super-sensitive person who is easily hurt. Words have a powerful effect on us humans especially those who care.

Everyone I know who teaches college has told me that this generation will tell them, in five minutes or less, their whole biography which often has graphic scenes of childhood trauma, sexual abuse, and emotional pain.

On the other hand, the book acknowledges what we know: the sky is not falling. Today is better than yesterday. Interracial marriage is accepted which was thought disgusting by most not too long ago. There are more opportunities for women and racial minorities than ever.

People do matter, and they should be allowed to express themselves.

However, people should care more about how others view them, and they should present themselves as best as possible while still being honest.

Some ideas are dumb like the biggest lie: "You create your own reality."

Overall, this book is excellent so far, and I am going to try to meet the author as she lives in San Diego.

  <title>Elitist Cyclists</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/10/21/elitist-cyclists/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Today, I was thinking of the whole notion of the elitist cyclist.

I think the whole thing is quite funny.

For example, McCain called cycling elitist and he called for defunding of cycling. This is so silly because if you look around you wonder if cycling is funded at all. 

It's as if I were calling you on the phone asking for the check I sent you back. Confused? Because I never did send you any money.

Still, I am having a great deal of fun with the notion that cycling is some how privilidged. I'm really interested in who comes up with this stuff.

I mean, McCain is a white male.

When you think about an elitist, what do you think of? I think of white males.

So a white male is now criticizing white males? That could be cool if were criticizing us for being assholes or something which many of us brats are. On the other hand, riding a bicycle hardly makes me an asshole.

I find it funny that Republicans are trying to stoke the hatred of the upper class and convert it to hatred of cyclists. Then again, Warren Buffet and William Gates III attended my last group ride so who am I to judge.

Perhaps McCain should get his ass on a bike and start networking! :)

To look deeper, I went to the source of all transportation knowledge, <a href="http://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/biking/city-biking/Rage-Against-Your-Machine.html?page=1">Tom Vanderbuilt</a>.

He talked a lot about in-group and out-group attitudes which was awesome.

"The dark side of the "cyclist" label is that it becomes a shortcut to social categorization."

As a Star Wars fan, I always rooted for the "dark side" so I am totally on board with this image.

Also, there are articles like <a href="http://www.usrbingeek.com/a/000711.php">this hate screed.</a>

I totally loved it especially about being a "hazard." Oh, I'm sorry to be slow and on the road. I guess all slow people should be killed like grandma. Note, the last sentence is sarcasm; I love my and your grandma.

Best line: "I am incredibly tired of cyclists with their holier-than-thou because-I'M-not-polluting attitudes."

It would suck for a cyclist to have a good feeling about themselves for something that is factually correct.

Also, note that though society embraces the bbf attitude: "blame bicyclists first", stats show that in the majority of accidents, cyclists were following the law and that motorists were at fault.

Finally, I am going to note that it's not so much that I feel superior to motorists because I bicycle, but rather I feel superior to nearly every other human on the planet for a myriad of reasons that I don't want to get into here.

Cycling is just the tip of the tip of the iceberg. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>The Third Variety</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/10/24/none/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The title of this article is a twist on one of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Variety">favorite stories.</a>

Long time readers know that the purpose of this blog is to discuss feelings--mine and others--regarding cycling.

Not the physics, gear ratio, nor the law, but rather the feeling one gets when commuter cycling and around the concept.

My latest quest is to generate more empathy on both sides of the windshield.

Last week, I did what I used to fear doing which was to look into the notion of the "elite cyclist". To summarize, when a motorist says "elite" they mean one of two things.

They usually mean VC cyclist, though they know not what it is. Or they mean someone who is "taking the lane" because there are no other facilities. The later category is not creaming his (yes HIS) pants over mixing with traffic, but rather pretty scared, and if they are aware of history, a bit pissed. 

I used to think that "elite" meant the whole notion of well educated, coastal, white people who actually cared for economic justice for the rest of the country. The term "elite" was used to get those people who would benefit the most from economic justice, but were duped by pointless "lifestyle" debates. 

I think that this is a mixup.

Anyway, my next stage in getting closer to the windshield (metaphorically) is to realize that there is little known on the driver side of the door about the history VC cycling and infrastructure planning.

I feel that we need to make this more widely known.

This is because the world I have been living in is too much of bubble with the same stuff getting repeated. I'd like to hear some input.

Too often motorists are blamed for poor infrastructure decisions. But are the motorists ever given a chance to discuss this? Perhaps we should listen more to what motorists have to say. Perhaps there should be more back and forth.

I mean to say, instead of VC idiots and brilliant infrastructure planners arguing, we should include motorists.

Too often infrastructurists are accused of being anti-motorist. To the contrary, I want to invite the motorist to the party.

For a motorist to get started in their quest for understanding of the "elites" I suggest that they look into these informative sites:

"Ninth Avenue cycle track in New York City. Photo: Beyond DC

Despite the constant controversy surrounding Forester, one organization that wholeheartedly embraced his ideas was the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. AASHTO’s influential design guide, which serves as the blueprint for most of the nation’s bike infrastructure, echoes many of his arguments about bicycle infrastructure.

The guide, last updated in 1999, recommends strongly against putting separated bike paths near roads for safety reasons, though it doesn’t mention cycle tracks explicitly. And it leaves out many of the more innovative and promising types of infrastructure — such as buffered contraflow lanes — entirely."

So if you are a motorist and are pissed and confused at why are there bikes on the road, here's the <a href="http://dc.streetsblog.org/2011/04/27/research-bolsters-case-for-cycle-tracks-while-aashto-updates-guide/">start of your answer.</a>

It would be unfair to not allow the <a href="http://www.johnforester.com/Articles/Social/Cyclist_vs_Bicycle_Advocacies.htm">great man</a> to respresent himself, so I linked to the place where he keeps his big pile of rope.

He is a kind, affable guy who loves to discuss his reasoning on emails. He recently got a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step-through_frame">mixte</a> in response to criticism that like the Pope, he wants to make the rules for a game he doesn't play. 

Still, he spent most of his life as a motorist, and he thinks it's best to create policies that dicourage "incompetent cycling" altogether. Thus, he'd love some emails or phone calls from motorists who think it's just dandy that they have to swerve to avoid the weekend Lances who are riding 15 MPH in the center of a 55 MPH lane.

Furthermore, like cripples and cretins, the whole VC term has gotten such a bad rap that like a snake shedding its skin, the VC movement is now calling itself <a href="http://cyclingsavvy.org/">savvy</a>

That's like me calling my riding style "Unparalleled". Hey, I think I'll trademark that. :)

So I'd like to say to the motorists out there--especially those of you with lots of bile, but not lives--welcome to the discussion. We'd love to be hearing on how much you love the VC, erm, Savvy movement. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Licenses To Ride</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/10/26/licenses-to-ride/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Every now and then, the idea of licensing bicycles comes up.

A lot of people waste a lot of time talking about it, but I don't think that it will ever happen. This is one of the many reasons that my second super-power, if I could have one, is to be invisible. 

My first power would to not want things, and to be equanamous which means, I won't need to be invisible.

Besides cyclists invisibility in the government due to malignant neglect, there are other reasons why licensing cyclists is a bad idea. The main reason is because it's a stupid idea.

Still, there are some motorists who say that cyclists should be licensed. The main reasoning seems to be the childist notion that "if I have to do it, they should have to do it."

I sort of agree, since, I, too am childish.

However, instead of licensing cyclists, I am starting to rethink licensing motorists.

I can hear the outrage now, "But that would be chaos."

Um, no. Anyone who cycles knows that it's chaos right now. I don't see how wasting people's time guarantees safety.

At best a license means that one passed a shitty test, by the third try, probably a long time ago. Then they immediately forget everything.

If you disagree, quick, recite the page on cycling.

"But without licensing fees, the roads will suck."

Bzzt. Wrong again. First of all in many areas, the roads all ready suck. Second, automobile related fees pay for HALF of the road costs at best. The rest of the money comes from other taxes which means that those us who don't drive pay extra for the roads. Not that I'm upset about this, or anything, I'm not a tight fisted libertarian. And yes, you are welcome, and you may keep the change.

"But the point of a license is that we can take it away if the driver does poorly."

Huh! Really. Because if this were the case, the buses and sidewalks should be way more crowded. Especially in terms of drinking and driving. So many people get away with it. They do it because they have to. If we really wanted to address drinking and driving bars would be in walkable neighborhoods, only. Plus NO PARKING for places that serve liquor. Also, cheap taxis and drunk buses would get people home safely. I always chuckle when some drunk tells me, "be safe", before they drink and drive. :)

Ending drinking and driving is all within our reach. In fact instead of wasting efforts on pointless paperwork like licensing, we should do this.

Still, we do want to prevent certain, incompetent or criminal, people from driving. How to do this?

I suggest a blacklist like a mail filter. Simply put a field in the criminal database for NO MOTORING. The police should be able to check this from their squad cars. No paperwork needed. 

The point is, though, there is no check to see if people are licensed so people drive all the time without licenses and only get caught when they wreck. What then? Do we remove their license to punish them. No, they don't have one to lose, thus the whole license thing is pointless for any kind of screening at all.

"How will we know who people are? Isn't this a security risk?"

What's going to happen, now, that didn't happen before? Did they not have proper IDs in 9/11? So the "safety" of an ID is mainly imaginary. The law enforcement part seems to come as an afterthought. 

This will remain a reality until we are all tracked with surgical implants. Trust me, as a lazy person with little notion of disobedience, I pray for the day. As long as they will give me a little bit of convenience such as letting me buy things charged to my account, with no chance of fraud, without hauling around a little plastic card.

"But until this rapture of the lazy geeks, we still need some way of identifying people."

I guess this is true as long as we are going to put important decisions, such as whether someone gets inebriated, in the hands of random people's brains and their facial recognition skills of a grainy photograph taken a while ago. Heck, I don't even have a beard in my license photo so I could be any bald white guy in that photo! :)

I don't mind having an ID, but why must it be tied to a single cram session of a little book on the operations of a vehicle that I don't spend a lot of time operating? Why not a state ID or even just issue all US citizens passports? That would shut up Europeans who mock us that so few Americans even have passports.

Now we're all international!]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Segregated Cycling</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[What do you think of when you read the title?

If you are like me, you might think of men in pointy white hats, Jim Crow, and people getting sprayed with hoses in Alabama.

When told that this is a "neutral" term, you might wonder why such a loaded term is being used.

In fact, the word sounds strangely like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word">weasel word.</a> By weasel word, I mean a word which is chosen, merely for its subjective effect.

Let's test this.

Do you think the originators of the term "segregated facilities" are in favor of them or against them. 

[The right answer is on the bottom--upside down. Turn your monitor over to read the answer.*]

The there's no better term for bike infrastructure than "segregated". Right?

Besides, I was told, that this term was used for years by transportation professionals.

My first piece of investigation to where segregated came from is on dictionaries of transportation.

The first one that I found was in 
<a href="http://www.i35waco.com/documents/glossary.shtml#S">Texas.</a>

According to the Texas Highway Department, "segregated facilities" means...uh, it has no meaning.

That's right, this "official" term, which was used for years is totally unknown by transportation professionals in Texas.

As much as I love Texas, perhaps that's just them. Let's be a bit less provincial.

Here's an organization which works with the US Transportation Department. Surely they would know what segregated means. Perhaps they would trace its long history and explain how it has nothing to do with Civil Rights.

According to RITA, segregated means <a href="http://www.bts.gov/dictionary/search.xml">nada.</a>

That's right, if it is an official term, it's also not defined by some of the biggest transportation dictionaries in the US.

Still, lest we be accused of deliberately finding dictionaries without the term because of our hidden agenda, aka not being a racist asshole, let's dig more.

Let's type <a href="http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;sugexp=kjrmc&amp;cp=12&amp;gs_id=2l&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=segregated+facilities&amp;pf=p&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;source=hp&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=segrgated+fa&amp;aq=0sx&amp;aqi=g-sx2g-msx2&amp;aql=f&amp;gs_sm=&amp;gs_upl=&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&amp;fp=a4183349b9a276ea&amp;biw=800&amp;bih=403">segregated facilities</a> into google.

Google, being googe, your milage may vary on this search.

For me, number one is racial segregation. Most of us think that's bad and linking cycling infrastructure with racism is pretty manipulative.

The second term is a wikipedia article we will go in to detail further so we'll set that aside for now.

Next, I have images of people in the South having to use separate toilets and drinking fountains.

Here I want a cycle track which will be used with all races and here we have images from a sad time in US history.

Next, is an agreement not to perform racist segregation.

Next are laws against racial segregation. Next is a site dealing with the pain of racism. 

Later on, we see sexism in segregation of facilities.

Only one article actually talks about this elusive term of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segregated_cycle_facilities">segregated facilities.</a>

Our old friend wikipedia.

There's a whole neutral article on segregation. Since it's on wikipedia, it has to be official and neutral, right?

If you look at the other uses of the word <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segregated">segregated</a> on wikpedia, indeed, we have some neutral uses of the term.

All of them are in chemistry or biology where the terms is used where things are separated. The terms seem to be old such as in taxonomy. One thing that all the neutral uses of segregation have in common is that the do NOT REFER TO PEOPLE.

I put that in all caps because, you will see that when people are involved segregation is not neutral.

Racial segregation, residential segregation, and so on.

Since segregated cycling facilities is used with regards to humans, we know this is also meant to be pejoratively.

Thus, the term is only used by those opposed to the facilities. Newcomers to advocacy who are in favor of facilities will sometimes use the term until they are corrected.

However, the discussion over terms sidetracks from real progress towards getting facilities. This is the real purpose of using the term.

I have not finished investigating the wikipedia page which is the only official looking page which mentions segregation and is not about racism. However, I suspect that this page is carefully crafted to look neutral.

Here's a <a href="http://search.fhwa.dot.gov/search?q=segregated&amp;btnG=Go&amp;ie=&amp;site=fhwa_web&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;client=fhwa_web&amp;lr=&amp;proxystylesheet=fhwa_web&amp;oe=&amp;as_sitesearch=mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov">clue.</a>

The wikipedia page links to the Federal Highway Administration. This is under their terminology section where it claims that "Various guides define the different types of bikeway..."

So I looked on their page to see if segregated was used. 

Indeed, the term is used. However, the usage is merely to speak of separating traffic. It's not used interchangeably with "bicycle infrastructure."

Thus, this the terminology links are there to imply that segregated is an official term without actually saying so which gives plausible deniablility.

But wait! 

Terms change and engineers often use terms that have double means. "Strap on" and "reach around" spring to mind in recent conversations with engineers who's minds are more innocent than my own.

I also know of the term "slave" used with hard drives. When I first heard it, I thought nothing of it. Once I realized it could be offensive, I started calling the drives primary and secondary, but didn't raise a fuss when others used it as it is official and meant to be neutral.

When I type the terms into google, though, won't we see people in shackles as well as guides to cable selection of the master hard drive?

Um, <a href="http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;sugexp=kjrmc&amp;cp=14&amp;gs_id=1m&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=master+slave+hard+drive&amp;pf=p&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;source=hp&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=master+slave+h&amp;aq=0&amp;aqi=g4&amp;aql=f&amp;gs_sm=&amp;gs_upl=&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&amp;fp=a4183349b9a276ea&amp;biw=800&amp;bih=368">no.</a>

Every single link is of a technical origin which is much different that the findings on a search for segregation.

Thus, I conclude that the term segregated when used for bicycle facilities is deliberately used by opponents of facilities, only, in order to don the mantle of civil rights. 

I find this to be highly offensive behavior without any merit (as it's not even funny!) :)

All this research may seem like overkill, but only if one is unaware of the whole mock "freak out", pretend offense that people take when they are caught at this racist stunt.

Thus, I searched exhaustively to prove that not only is this term used in a bizarre way to inject racism in order to win an argument which is doomed, but also that the people who use it and deny its manipulative origins are liars as well.

=================================

* People who made up the term segregation are opposed to bike facilities.

  <title>Get the F--- Out!</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the main reasons why I live in City Heights is because it has a tiny strip of land set aside for children to play.

This is tiny, about half a city block, and it probably serves from four to eight square blocks. 

Next to it, is a mammoth soccer field which is so huge that a good portion of it is left idle, like a farmer's field.

The field is also used by children for recess which is great. I used to play on a concrete parking lot so to see children in the "ghetto" playing on a huge grassy field, makes me smile.

But for the rest of the community with their spontaneous play, there's only a tiny sliver of concrete. This includes skateboarding, smoking weed, making out, and more.

I can't over-estimate how cool this tiny pedestrianized area is in San Diego.

For starters, it's quiet.

A lot of people who come here have a really great time, which is nice, but it puts some kind of rose colored goggles on a person.

If you live here long enough you realize that it's really LOUD outside. Like everywhere.

This kind of offsets the benefits we have regarding the great weather.


Anyway, this tiny strip of paradise reminds me of the other fantastic neighborhood that I wanted to live in which is Jackson Heights in Queens, NYC.

In both places, there was a good mix of races as well as a generous amount of children playing by themselves which makes for a solid community.

Another place that this strip of paradise reminds me of is The Promenade in Santa Monica. 

Overall, the number of people who enjoy this tiny strip of land if much more than the normal streets. It's totally safe as it has a strong police presence.

For these reasons, I ride through there everyday.

I realize that I am the "old guy." 

Mostly, the children and I ignore one another, though I do smile to myself because I so love to see skateboarding.

The few times I had contact with the kids, it's been positive.

One time, they saw my basket loaded with beer, and they said, "party at his house."

I replied, "everyday's a party at my house."

The other time, the kids were in my way while I was walking my bicycle, heavily loaded with library books, and I said excuse me to someone in my way.

The other kids said, "Hey! Get out of his way. Show some manners."

Today, though, I had the best experience ever.

The promenade was so crowded with moms, skaters, skater groupies, and children, that I walked my bicycle.

I realized that there was a car going through the area. Now, I realize that it's possible for vehicles to go through the area. There are routine police cars and service vehicles which are there on official business.

But this was a civilian car and the skaters were having none of it.

"Get the fuck out of here!" they said.

I was shocked!

They went up to the police and reported the car. 

The police said, "We all ready talked with them."

I was so proud.

One of a sign of a strong community is the willingness of adults who are not the child's parent to reprimanding these kids.

How strong is a community when the children reprimand non-parent adults?]]></content:encoded>

  <title>The Award Winning City of 2011</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Foreword:

I am often told that I should not be obsessed with winning arguments with the VC/savvy cyclist as research has invalidated their ideas, and American cities are waking up from the petrol fume induced slumber to recreate themselves on a human scale again.

While that's partially true, the vast VC wing conspiracy is still haunting us. Plus, VCers are fun to mock and everyone humorist needs a safe target.

Plus, it scores points with the ladies or rather one all important lady, my princess. :)

Plus, blogs need to create BS awards and give them to one another. I don't know why, but this is the way of the blogosphere.

Thus, I give the world, the VC Award.

I will give this award to the city that most traffic deaths due to the highest VC infestation. :)

Thus without further ado, I bequeath the 2011 VC City of the Year to <a href="http://www.infrastructurist.com/galleries/album/72157627939650242/photo/6264371420/10-of-the-scariest-places-to-live-in-the-u-s-the-orlando-kissimmee-region-of-florida.html">Mickey Mouse Town!</a>

That's Orlando for all you hipsters. I was last there when I was nine years old.

Now, I want to go back and ride my bicycle.

Just kidding.


10 of the Scariest Places to Live in the U.S.
The Orlando-Kissimmee Region of Florida
« Prev
5 of 10
Next »

"There have been over 5,550 deaths in the Orlando-Kissimmee region, an average of 3 per 100,000 people. This number tallies both car crashes and pedestrian casualties, which are so high that the region was ranked by Transportation for America as the single most dangerous place for pedestrians."

I know there is no mention of bicycles above, but it is still very relevant.

This is because it's known that the more difficult bicycling is, the more unpleasant it is for us all.

Making a place more bicycle friendly reduces deaths of pedestrians AND motorists. If this makes it more dangerous for us cyclists--as VCers claim, then it's a worthy sacrifice. (Hint it's not).

We need to think of all road users not just ourselves.

This winner didn't totally surprise me because as I said above, the VC cyclists are fairly vehement. It's where I got in a debate over infrastructure. 

Among other things, one of their debate tactics was to accuse me of having a complete set of functioning emotions ("You're fearful.") Guilty of not being a robot. :)

Of course, due to complete luck, God, and awesome debate tactics, I happened to burn this debate to the ground.

Still, on the ground it appears that the VCers have prevailed.

With a body count of 5,550 who can touch them?

Not even Dallas which had, for years, someone who claimed to be a bicyclist, but was really a Quisling.

For perspective, there are about 5,000 pedestrian deaths in the WHOLE US so I'd like to see the data broken out better, but I don't have time for more research on my short lunch break.

Also, not that less than 700 deaths IN THE WHOLE US are from cycling so the 5000 plus number from Orlando must include many motorist fatalaties as well. 

This would be totally ironic if it weren't so sad.

As the Dead Milkmen liked to say, "It might not be the blues, but it [their guitar playing] does make me cry." :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>What Does it Mean to Be A Real Advocate?</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/11/02/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-real-advocate/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Princess started this discussion last night and we had yet another very interesting topic at our household.

Since I have been studying language, I am suspicious of certain words where people have differing opinions on.

That's because words map onto reality, and when people disagree about a word, they are really disagreeing about something more fundamental.

For example, when one argues over "What is God", people are really arguing over who has authority to speak for God. Once you unmask this, your realize that this isn't like debating a word in scrabble, but rather it's a struggle for power.

As for advocacy, to me, it's like feminism and women. Everyone wants one, but nobody wants to say that they are feminists. 

Likewise, I feel that advocacy has gotten some bad press. Heck, it's happening now with Occupy Wall Street which is obvious an attempt to gain economic justice, something that we all agree upon in principle, yet the protesters are treated like aliens. And there are countless movies such as "I Heart the Huckabees" which portray advocates as selfish losers and bad poets.

Note that I am using the word broadly. In a debate over the meaning of a word, there are lumpers (who want to make the word mean many things) and splitters (who like a narrow definition).

It's usually the splitters who dash to the dictionary to narrow down the meaning.

My point of view?

I don't really think that the meanings of words are so important--I'd like to move beyond that.

One method of doing this is to blow up the word. That is to refuse to accept it to mean something. Instead of using the word, put a bunch of words to mean what you think that word means.

For me, a cycling advocate is someone who wants cycling to be better for themselves, and they'd like to share their experiences with others.

Thus, I guess this makes all of us cyclist bloggers, advocates, in some way. Save for the VC bloggers, though, as they want to DISCOURAGE people from riding unless they kiss His Holiness's ring.

Anyway, anyone who promotes cycling as being a fun thing to do, where you don't have to take a class, is an advocate.

Anyway, the word for the day is ADVOCATE.

Tomorrow's post is going repeat the old saw that "Death is not dangerous". We'll explain how safety means rinding in a style where you maximize the chance of getting run over and dying, but minimizes the chance that you skin your knee. :)

  <title>Making Everyone Happy</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Before I post my main post, I wanted to link to this:

<a href="http://workmadeforhire.wordpress.com/2011/10/28/youre-wrong/">We're all wrong.</a>

Because I believe this article, and know that I can never be objective, I don't even try. I live in a subjective world people!

Since we can't be rational (what does that even mean), we should embrace the irrational and live in a fuzzy world of feelings. :)

Back to the scheduled program.

Sometimes, it's stupid to try to make everyone happy, but then there are those brilliant flashes where you realize that actually it's easy to do, sometimes!

Now, I know that there will be objections to this plan, but they will be ad hoc arguments just because like above, we are all idiots who believe what we believe and the hell with the "facts".

The idea is infrastructure that everyone loves: cyclists, motorists, pedestrians, and even VCers.

Here's the notion:

Since many drivers, especially in SD, love, love, love to ride in the bike land and gutter and hate to take the second lane, why not put the bike lane in the center of the road?

On nearly any street in SD there's a center part of the road that's almost never used.

This area is relatively free of trash.

It also can be protected by double yellow lines because there's the notion that San Diegans won't cross a yellow line even to give a cyclist some space. Let's put the yellow line between ourselves and the world.

We are in the exact middle of the road. If "taking the lane" in the VC world, is good, taking the fucking center of the road must be best.

Also, we are free of bike salmon. They will continue to ride on the wrong side of the road on the shoulder. 

Let them have it. Leave them alone.

We're now in the center of the road.

Also, there's no more right hook, and no merges as we are all ready in the center. 

Green arrows are for left turns only. Cyclists will wait behind the crosswalk line and thus be safe from the left hook. If we want to turn left, we are all ready in the right lane so no crossing two lanes which hurt my friend the other day.

The only objection to this is that people aren't used to it.

Well guess what, people aren't used to a lot of things, but we can all learn.

We aren't all retards who's minds can't adapt. So that whole last argument was insulting.

Also, for motorists who don't know we aren't supposed to be there, they won't hit us. We are protected by a double yellow line.

Oh, and we are to paint in huge letters BIKE LANE all over the bike lane just in case someone says, "get out of the middle of the road and into the bike lane", we now get to mock their idiot reading comprehension (or lack thereof).

So there you go, a perfect solution to a problem that was created due to ignorance and stupidity in the first place.

Don't all thank me at once. 

Wait behind the double yellow line! :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Bike Summit: First Encounter</title>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Last weekend, I went to a Bike Summit in beautiful downtown LA. 

I saw, "beautiful", because it reminded me of any other East Coast City. Heck the weather was the same as well--at least for a late fall or early spring.

There is so much to cover regarding this summit so I'm going to break this up into multiple posts.

One of the first people I spoke with was from the Culver City Bike Coalition.

LA County has 88 cities, so the goal is to make a coalition for each city. So far there are about a dozen.

We saw the fruits of their labor in Santa Monica a couple of months ago with all the new bike racks, lanes, and the diverse riders.

Culver City seems to be organizing as well.

The Culver City rep, Steve, had some great advice for 
<a href="http://www.saferoutesinfo.org/">Safe Routes to School.</a> I'm going to link to this for now, but I'll have more details on this excellent program later.

As for now, he wanted to have a safe route near his home, but the whole thing got torpedoed by one, old crochety guy. It seems like this is always the case.

You can have thousands of letters against a freeway, none for it, and still get a freeway. On the other hand, any tiny change which would actually save the lives of people seems to be subject to the whims of every single person on the planet who can pen a letter in English.

There's definitely still a bias towards the dubious goal of endless traffic flow for no other purpose.

So the take home message from this campaign is to get the message our first.

That is, Mr. Crotchety made up nonsense about the changes and posted it on flyers. If the Safe Routes people had struck first with flyers then they could have won.

The second message is to compromise. 

Usually, the purpose of a person to get something changed is fear and ego. You can reduce both by bringing such clueless busy bodies into the process early.

If they had made a single street two way instead of one way, this guy would have had no objection to the plan. 

Instead of compromising, though, the Safe Routes people suggested that Mr. Crotchety to speak directly to the city to have that single piece changed. This is a mistake because if you let anyone talk to the city, they will go off message.

There's no way we are all experts in traffic planning just because we drive a car or own a house. Thus, we should buffer the complaints, take them seriously, but don't allow the person to totally object. Give the person a good feeling and make minor changes.

Cities actually like bike organizations to be buffers for complaints because they give people political cover which allows them to take bigger risks. Also, they would prefer to speak with one group with one plan rather than have to try to make a lot of people happy.

Remember, we can't even agree, with friends, on pizza toppings. In the selfish world of traffic planning, there's no way we are going to make everyone happy with a plan.

However, once a plan is put into place, people are usually happy with a people-centric design.

Go figure.

Thanks to Steve to give us the benefit of hindsight. They tried their best to get a better route to the school and had no way they'd be blind-sided by Mr. Crotchety. I'm sure that with their experience, they'll win this one in the future.

  <title>Bike Summit: Long Beach</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I am often accused (by San Diegans) of being too provacative.

Yet, I see that in some of the speeches, the people are even more provacative in some sense. Thus, I don't agree with the tone 100%, but I must have some partial agreement because I did write down the comments. :)

I really enjoyed the speech from Charles of Long Beach.

I had recently seen what great things they are doing there including the first, downtown, cycle track. Indeed, there is a cycle track in San Diego by Friars Road. However, this is a high speed road, and unlike the Copenhagen style cycle track of Long Beach.

Charles showed how it's necessary to have a goal and an aspiration which is something that I have said, for years, that we are severely lacking. I have some more quotes from a number of speakers so I will fondly call them all "he".

Government and planners of Long Beach aspire to make it the "Best Bike City in the World". I loved to hear that. I think we should all aim so high.

Much economic redevelopment was done in Long Beach due to modest spending on bicycles.

Those complaining about the small space devoted to bicycles are "highway alarmists".

"California is on the verge of [bicycle] greatness."

"The highway lobby thinks that it owns the roads, and that they are only concerned about 'slow traffic'".

But when a cyclist (or anyone else) is hit, it really slows down traffic. :)

Now that we are entering an era of fewer resources, we are going to finally be free of the tyrrany of wealth.

Most arguments against cycling spending make no sense, and are often "made up on the spot."

Overally, we should work with the Highway Lobby aka AAA and friends, in order to make the roads better because we are entering a time of decreased wealth but increased road users.

It was highly refreshing to go a meeting and to hear my own language, what I expected from advocates all along.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Dave Snyder gave an inspirational speech.

I thought, "wow!", this is what I wanted to hear.

He said that "we're winning" and "we're on the right side of history."


"The only problem is that we aren't winning fast enough."

Yes! Think success.

Then he went on to elaborate some of the benefits of infrastructure which include "allowing our neighbors to enjoy bicycling."

He also went into the economic benefits infrastructure.

He mentioned that the anti-cycling attacks were good because it meant that we were making an impact. 

I totally agreed as I saw a backlash as inevitable, but not as bad as many in San Diego fear. I think we definitely need to get to the point where we can flush all the backlashers out of the closet.

Once we get their arguments into the light, how lame they are will be self-evident.

Then he brought out numbers. The upside is that one area almost recouped their total investment in a single year.

I usually forget about the economic and other effects of infrastructure, but I do know that increased comfort and safety are the tip of the iceberg.

In some places there are even four star hotels with bike parking. 

He noted that the street plans are NOT democratic. We never had a vote to give away the streets to cars.

If a travel lane is too small for two vehicles to ride, side by side, the bicycle is not the problem. :)

The California Vehicle manual is often seen as the bible created by "wise elders". In reality, it's just some people's opinions and it's subject to change.

Not only that, but one can innovate in the form of an experiment such as the proposed bike boxes in San Luis Obisbo.

I had often heard that traffic experiments were highly dangerous because is someone got hurt, they could sue.

I found this funny because the streets that are in code kill tons of people and there's no notion of 38,000 lawsuits per year for that.

Yet, Dave said that traffic experiments are shielded from liability. Thus, I learned that this excuse is either due to ignorance or outright deception. Due to my Cross Traffic Study findings, this won't be the first time we'd been lied to by Quisling advocates.

I'll write more about Cross in another post where I look at some hard numbers.

Dave was really blowing my mind, and I glanced over to princess who was also enjoying this inspiration.

He said that the Highway Design Manual was being misused as it was for highways, only, yet somehow they started running amuck and trying to design everything like a [god damned] freeway.

He noted that in fact public streets are the majority of public space, but we treat them like they are a lost cause instead of allowing everyone to play in them.

Also, I learned that one can innovate a great deal, as a planner, and be shielded from legal liability because that's why we have humans designing things, so they can use their intelligence and judgment.

At any rate, people really like to bicycle. 10% of tourists in San Francisco rented bicycles, for example.

After the talk, my friend let me know that in the DC bike share, there were a million trips and that there were only 19 accidents and ZERO fatalities: an extremely safe activity. Let's think of that next time someone says, "Be safe." :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Bike Summit: Helpful References</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I thought that it would make sense to have some information on how things get planned.

People tossed these words around so I decided to look some things up:

<a href="http://www.transportation.org/default.aspx?siteid=37&amp;pageid=310">AASHTO</a>:

"AASHTO is a nonprofit, nonpartisan association representing highway and transportation departments in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. It represents all five transportation modes: air, highways, public transportation, rail, and water. Its primary goal is to foster the development, operation, and maintenance of an integrated national transportation system."

<a href="http://nacto.org/cities-for-cycling/design-guide/">Nacto:</a>

(This is starting to sound like a snacks commercial.)

From what I could gather, Nacto is the response to Aashto:

"The NACTO Urban Bikeway Design Guide is based on the experience of the best cycling cities in the world. The designs in this document were developed by cities for cities, since unique urban streets require innovative solutions. Most of these treatments are not directly referenced in the current versions of the AASHTO Guide to Bikeway Facilities or the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), although many of the elements are found within these documents. The Federal Highway Administration has recently posted information regarding approval status of various bicycle related treatments not covered in the MUTCD, including many of the treatments provided in the NACTO Urban Bikeway Design Guide. All of the NACTO Urban Bikeway Design Guide treatments are in use internationally and in many cities around the US."

Finally, we have a really cool manual, <a href="http://modelstreetdesignmanual.com/">The Model Design Manual For Living Streets.</a>

This is the kind of innovation I love to see by transportation advocates:

"This manual focuses on all users and all modes, seeking to achieve balanced street design that accommodates cars while ensuring that pedestrians, cyclists and transit users can travel safely and comfortably. This manual also incorporates features to make streets lively, beautiful, economically vibrant as well as environmentally sustainable.

Cities may use this manual in any way that helps them update their current practices, including adopting the entire manual, adopting certain chapters in full or part, modifying or customizing chapters to suit each city’s needs."

In summary, there's a great deal of innovation that's happening. Much of this information is available for free online.

The goal is to get the adoption and implementation of the best practices from the two manuals especially the last one.]]></content:encoded>

(I wish they had published the source files like Los Angeles did instead of just a PDF, so it would be easy to substitute right-hand traffic and imperial measures for the US in place of their left-hand traffic and metric measures.)]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Bike Summit: Multimodal Activism</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/11/13/bike-summit-multimodal-activism/</link>

  <guid isPermaLink="false">http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/11/13/bike-summit-multimodal-activism/</guid>
  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[One of my favorite themes of the conference was the focus on multi-modal activism.  

The activists I'm most familiar with are prone to just focusing on cycling and motoring, often as competing modes. Even when there is acknowledgement that accommodating cyclists will enhance all forms of transportation, we still seem to neglect the other modes and how they will all integrate together.

This is a paramount issue for many reasons.

One of them is that in places like San Diego, especially, cycling everywhere is impossible. Even if you are a super-hero, there aren't enough hours in the day; it's too spread out.

Also, I really like to walk. Somedays, I'd just like to sit down on a train. 

But the problem is that we often have a winner take all feeling especially in the non-cycling communities. Most cyclists that I know are 100% on board with multi-modal.

However, at the funding level, we are often told by motorists to fight for a few crumbs. This brings advocates of transit, walking, cycling, and handicapped into conflict.

This is a really stupid approach.

I got a taste of this when I listened to the pedestrian and transit advocate talk. I really regret not being able to speak with her one on one; this didn't work out logistically.

I could, see, however, that she shared, in a small way, some ill will towards cyclists. 

We totally can not control how people think, but I did feel that cyclists were responsible, in some way, for her feelings.

I would really like to reach out, with love, to the other communities. I feel like we should work together and spend money on all modes save for motoring; we literally spent enough money on cars to make the US a paradise several times over. All we have is the hungry ghost and lame whining for more lanes for cars only and more free real estate. In some ways, I'd like to keep building for cars and to pave over our planet.

But this is stupid and spiteful, and the conference showed me that there's not just a better way possible, but positive change is happening now.

Still, like others have mentioned, why do cyclists ALWAYS have to be the bigger person? Can't someone, handicapped, motorist, pedestrian, alien, whatever, to us and say, "How can we accomodate you?"

This NEVER happened to me. I come in with smiles and good cheer and all I get from others is mockery, derision, or at best sad, resigned defeatism. I'm ALWAYS the most positive person on cycling. ALWAYS.

I so long for someone to smile and let me complain and just LISTEN. Just one non-cyclist. 

No worries; I'll continue to be the happy face. I'll continue to smile, and try to be positive.

Transport love to all.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Bike Summit: SB375</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/11/15/bike-summit-sb375/</link>

  <guid isPermaLink="false">http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/?p=903</guid>
  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Here's a summary of what was said relating to this exciting law:

While people act as if cycling were so expensive we actually have quite a bit of cold hard cash available for cycling infrastructure, eductation, and other cycling related events.

This money is available on the federal and state levels. When people say, "we have no money", they are really saying that they have different priorities. 

On top of that, when you realize the amount of money that we spend on frivolous shit, widening roads that don't need it, building houses that nobody lives in, and so on, you realize that if we picked up all the change from the money wasted, we'd be able to build Copenhagen several times over. And I'm not mentioning the health benefits.

Then someone came out at as a bike activist masquerading as a climate activist. Such a nice thing to say. Personally, I see no conflict between promoting cycling and promoting a clearer environment. 

Finally someone mentioned a law called 
<a href="http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/sb375/sb375.htm">SB375</a> which states that the regional transportation plan must plan to reduce greenhouse gases.

This is hilarious because San Diego's plan will clearly raise greenhouse gases.

In fact, the only real way to reduce greenhouse gases is to narrow roads. If this is not done then the plan is illegal.

Again, as someone who has heard many complaints about scofflaw cyclists, I hear zero outcry from those people when it comes to how massively illegal that this plan is. Not only that, but they have panels of experts and an enormous budget to study this thing to death. It doesn't take an expert to see that more lanes = more cars = more greehouse gases. It's just as simple as that.

I really like how integrated this plan is:

"Each of California’s MPOs then prepare a "sustainable communities strategy (SCS)" that demonstrates how the region will meet its greenhouse gas reduction target through integrated land use, housing and transportation planning."

Seeing as I hear over and over again that "cycling isn't practical because things are too far", this law does a lot to address that.

So next time someone complains about bike lanes or the "greenhouse conspiracy", you can shrug and say, although that's all well and good, it doesn't matter because planning for greenhouse gases is the law.

Let's see how far San Diego puts it's usual obsession with following the law. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[While some of the speakers were talking, there were a few assumptions that sounded good, but I wasn't sure whether I totally agreed with.

One of them was the notion that we have to buy into motorists selfishness in order to "sell" cycling.

In many ways, that does sound reasonable. After all, good advertising functions best when it can tap into preconceived impulses and ideas. It's a fool's errand to try to change human nature.

On the other hand, how selfish are we, really?

Although there are many ads on TV that promote selfishness, I wonder if that's because it's necessary to be selfish in order to crave their products.

On the other hand, is there any way to tap into people's natural feelings of altruism?

I don't mean people's guilt, I mean their wanting to help others. For example, there's usually a huge outpouring for disaster victims and there was a huge groundswell of support for US soldiers aka "support the troops."

In the same way, why does it always have to be motorists vs. cyclists? 

Why can't motorists voluntarily give up some of their space, money, etc, for cyclists?

I'm not saying that this is the only way to go. 

Selfishness does exist. Motoring ads and lifestyle encourage and tap into infantile selfishness.

But people are not simple creatures who are all selfish or all altruistic.

Perhaps by merely mentioning and trying to play into people's selfishness, we make them more selfish.

If I talk about food, you become hungry. If I talk about selfishness, you will probably think along those lines. I wonder how many people will think altruism if this is presented to them in the right way?

Anyway, these are just some of my own personal thoughts while listening to speakers.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Bike Summit: More Gems and a Scarlet Dot</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[We had a session where we were to give our ideas on how to make cycling great in California. After lunch, we were to vote on these ideas. I only wrote down a fraction of the shiny gems.

They stated by talking about how transportation budgets actually distort our communities because we wind up focusing on how to spend the money we have instead of what we want our community to look like. For example, if 80% of the money is for motoring and bridges only, that's what we are going to get. So we should make the budgets more flexible to remedy this problem.

We can also work on fixing existing roads instead of building new ones. Personally whenever they are making new roads, I do envision everything paved over. I did see some of that, last night, in Mission Valley which is essentially all pavement with a few tiny buildings in between cars which are moving really quickly.

There were many more ideas. My friend said that he endorsed all of them. However, we had one vote AGAINST an idea. 

I did vote against the studying of health effects of cycling infrastructure because I don't like ANY kind of metric or microscope put on cycling only.

I noticed, in the past, that this is one good way to kill something: to study it to death. The more info, only, on a single thing, the more risk it will be canceled.

I would have been happy if they looked at the health effects of ALL modes. However, I can only vote on what is in front of me.

During lunch, another friend asked me why I voted against this idea, and I explained, but she said that I misunderstood. 

My friends wanted to vote against me!

Indeed there were some people who walked around with negative votes, the scarlet red dot, on their name tags. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Bike Summit: Complete Steets I (and a rant about gentrification)</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Before I go on, I want to link to an article which is unrelated to this post, <a href="http://hembrow.blogspot.com/2011/02/all-those-myths-and-excuses-in-one-post.html">Excuses for Not Cycling.</a>

On to regularly scheduled post:

This was a very well attended meeting. The goal was for us to discuss complete streets.

The agenda was: figure out our goal, increase cycling, tally up pluses and minuses, find allies and opponants, and finally determine some tactics.

As per the normal tradition, by the time most of you hear this you'll have to realize that the cool kids have moved on.

Sure Complete Streets are cool, but the avante guard among us is now talking about Complete Communities. :)

At the beginning of the talk, I asked a question about how to visualize complete streets. I thought it would be nice to see a map where we were coloring it all in so I could track progress.

I was told that Complete Streets isn't so much about building a network as it is a process on a case by case basis. Thus a street can become more and more "Complete".

During the meeting, I found that the Long Beach reps were super-helpful because they all ready had a success story to share. Long Beach is giving the rest of the state something to go after, a target.

Next, we identified allies which were business improvement districts, home owner associations, media, and enlightened engineers.

I found this interesting as it brings up that dreaded term "gentrification". 

Ug, how I hate that word because it's such a hot button issue, but unlike other hot button issues, it's so vague.

I mean, we all know what a gun and an abortion is, but what's a gentrification?

Making things better in poor areas. And why is that bad? What's the opposite of this? Slumification. And that's good? We need poor people to live in slums?

But we need to have places for poor people to live. 

So build them all ready and make them nice. I had very little money for years, and I did not want to live in a shit hole.

Talk with any poor person and ask her what her problems are. You can go for hours and never hear about gentrification. 

Why?

Because poor people want to live in nice places.

In fact, I bet one of her long term goals is to get enough money together to get the fuck out of her slum and to move into a nice GENTRIFIED area.

In fact, instead of worrying about keeping slums as slums how about focusing on getting more money to poor people so that they can pay higher rents?

What I am saying is that among all the poor person's problems living in a nicer place is the goal NOT a problem.

While I'm ranting, I'm sick of how people use the words like "slum" for non-white areas, only. A neighborhood can have low crime and have a strong community, but if it's non-white, it will be called a slum.

Then you will have old white dudes coming in to tell the government that they shouldn't do anything to fix the place up because rent will be too high.

I suggest a better alternative is to make the areas nicer and to help the people who live there to stay. This will make an even stronger community.

Also, it's helpful not to think in terms of "nice areas" and "slums" but to travel freely to all parts of town. The whole notion of a slum is a creation of the human mind, first, and it's reinforced by people's prejudices.

So if a standard is good for one area, a "nice one" then it should also apply to another area no matter who lives there.

Have a nice day.

  <title>Qualcomm Stadium Bike Paths and Rain Checks</title>

Long time readers know that part of my lovely commute takes me across Qualcomm Bicycle path which is really a strip of land that the stadium allows for bicycles (and mostly pedestrians) to travel through.

I love the path for many reasons, and one of them is that I become far more relaxed once I get to the parking lot because there's usually less traffic, and it's much quieter.

However, one of the downsides is that it becomes a small pond every time that it rains.

Thankfully, it does not rain too often, but when it does, it floods.

Readers not from San Diego probably know that things do not have to be this way.

There are such notions as "drainage".

But the problem extends beyond a few feet of water in a parking lot.

The other problem is run off in the form of silt and stones.

Previously, I have blogged about the efforts done to dredge the nearby creek.

However, there are more obvious things that can be done.

One of them would be to build a wall which is large enough to contain most of the silt and stones.

Additionally, many of the silt and stones can be removed.

This same problem is evident along Fairmont as I had previously talked about. I feel that there's a similar solution possible for this problem.

  <title>The Case of the Skipping Chain</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Since a bicycle has so few parts, you'd think that this would result in things being easier to diagnose. This is true some of the time, however, sometimes, it's still a mystery at least to me.

Take my latest woe, the skipping chain. This really, really sucks especially going up a hill. It sucks the energy from each turn of the pedal when you need it the most.

At first, I thought that this was due to a dirty chain. Cleaning my chain had worked wonders in the past. I was especially heartened when I saw that there was a big build up of grease on my bottom cassette which was pushing the chain off the teeth.

After I spent two lunches cleaning my chain, cassette, and derailleur, things got worse!

I knew what I had to do, I had to change my chain.

So I pedaled the dangerous trip that it was to my "local" bicycle shop, and I bought a new chain.

Of course, I put it on wrong--I always put it on wrong. There's always some piece of metal or another that it needs to be over or under and I mess it up. Plus each time, there's a different way to put it on. In the past, there was the difficult, but reversible chain breaker. Then they went to the five dollar bolts that you had to buy each time you used. Plus you needed to snap them off. What a strange thing. Next, they moved onto the master link which seemed great, but once you get it on, you can't get it off!

Since I all ready sealed the deal with my master link, I was stuck using the chain breaker which is not recommended for my chain (9 speed) because it "weakens the chain"

I had no choice other than to use another chain (which I made sure to buy). I was doing all this work outside the bike shop in case I messed something up. Haha!

Being frugal, I wanted to try to save the expensive chain so I did use the chain breaker. However, it wasn't breaking right, it was warping the chain!

Ug, can nothing go right? Finally, I managed to get the chain on in a ghetto fashion. The fact that things worked at all amazed me.

Of course, once the chain was on, did this cure the mysteriousness chain skip.

Hell no!

In fact, it was worse than ever. Much worse.

So bad that I had to use the middle speed, only, which makes going up hills, really, really tough.

More tomorrow as the plot thickens.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>The Chain of Destruction</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This is the next installment of my mission to fix my bicycle.

Yesterday, my sweet Princess suggested that we meet at Adams Bicycle Shop so we did.

There, I met a brilliantly named mechanic called Freddie who worked with me to figure out what went wrong with my bicycle and how to fix it. He had that rare combination of intelliegence and kindness rarely seen in bicycle mechanics.

Looking at my cassettes, he agreed that they were stripped which is one of the reasons why things skipped. He admitted to trying to fix up older bicycles, and it just made things worse.

What most likely happened is that once I changed chains, I created a situation where the new strong chain quickly stripped the cassette teeth much quicker than the older chain which had aged along with the casettes.

Take home lesson for me is that if the chain skips, I will have a new front and a new back cassette ready to change before I bother changing the chain. I could have saved myself from such pain if I had done this.

I also ordered a new seat because I had destroyed the old one, probably by riding too hard. It's tough being a strong, bad-ass cyclist. :)

I also ordered a new back tire. Freddie pointed out that the front tire had ridges on the sides which allowed it to perfectly line up with my light from Sweden.

Usually bike repair and especially going on about bicycle parts bores me to tears, but in this case, I was somewhat interested as this was a path out of the pain I face now where I have to climb a hill in second gear, and I'm even slower starting up from a stopped position.

Thank-you Freddie for cheering me up and giving me hope. Also, thanks as always to Princess.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Bike Summit: Fat Roads</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The next speaker was totally brilliant. He was from the Netherlands, but he worked in the United States for many years as a traffic planner.

&nbsp;

He had just completed a bicycle tour in the Netherlands, where there are many more cyclists. Still, he noted that the code for roadway design in the United States is superior to that of the Netherlands.

That is, the standard design for bicycle infrastructure is much higher in the US than in many parts of Europe. Therefore, he noted that the roadway manuals, which many people would like to improve in the United States, as a way of making cycling better, are all ready good enough.

However, we do have a unique problem in the United States which is caused by many factors including our reluctance for through streets (in Southern California especially), our reliance on "arterial roads", and our lack of understanding of basic traffic flow concepts like induced traffic.

Thus, the problem is that our roads are too wide.

No matter how excellent our infrastructure is, it can not mitigate the problems caused by overly fast, noisy, busy, and wide roads.

Even if we have perfect cycle tracks everywhere, this problem of fat roads remains.

The problem of fat roads is NOT caused by design manuals nor by engineers (on their own).

Rather, it's caused by politicians who want to placate their constituents.

Thus, the only real solution to the problems of our dangerous roads is to shrink the roads.

This is done by a road diet which currently is a very tough sell because of people's basic lack of understanding of many things.

This can, in part, be accomplished by changing the status quo.

Currently, the car is the controlling agent.

This is so true. Think of the places you can get to by train, bus, or by bicycle.

Now think of the places you can get to by car.

Thus, the car is the "controlling agent".

Future planners should think of a bicycle as a "design vehicle".

There was much more said by this amazing person. I was totally enthralled, and if not married, I would have propositioned this guy! :)

Rarely do I hear a talk so inspiring and so challenging to even my radical beliefs in urban design.

However, there were many of these talks both before and after this one, that inspired me in similar ways.

Still, of all the talks, I was happiest to have gone to this one due to it's sheer brilliance.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>What's Luck Got To With It?</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This blog is supposed to be about the cotton candy and rainbow aspect of cycling. Instead it gets into the dirty politics as well as enumerating every problem from a little annoyance to hellish nightmares that are brought upon by choosing to cycle in a place which spends billions of dollars to discourage it.

Nevertheless, I have learned that I need to embrace all of my emotions, so I'll do that.

One of the things that really makes my blood boil when it comes to cycling, aside from the boring, sadistic jokes, is the notion that I'm somehow "lucky" that I can cycle to work--and everywhere else.

The one thing I am not is lucky.

Well, yes, I am lucky for many reasons, such as for having a wonderful princess. However, I am not lucky to be able to cycle because like I said, the government as well as private industries spend a shit ton of money to stop me from cycling or at least to make it seem scary and hellish.

There's the nearly total lack of cycle parking, to the hidden government subsidies for motoring, to the ubiquitous red carpet that private industry lays out to motorists. There's also the nightmarish aspects of my commute as well as the fact that there are wall--I mean freeways--which block my "right to the road" at every turn.

Yet, I cycle everywhere. Why?

Luck! :)

No, silly, it's probably because of force of habit. At this point, I really don't know why.

But it's NOT due to luck.

Here's how luck is made.

First of all, we chose to live in the most pedestrian friendly, and biking friendly neighborhood. This place was chosen to be near my and my princesses jobs. We also chose it to be close enough to ride to the beach at least once a week.

Next, we don't have a car. If something can't be biked to in ten miles of less: IT DOESN'T EXIST.

There's nothing "practical" about this lifestyle.

That is, I totally hate it when people say it's not "practical" to cycle to my job or with my kids or whatever else.

Clue train: We don't live in Soviet Russia.

Automobiles are really, really expensive and they take a long time to maintain. Can someone with children really be expected to look after the sheer amount of paperwork and the amount of money spent motoring?

What about food and medical care not to mention college money. Isn't it a bit, say, impractical, to waste this money on motoring when it's just as easy and convenient to walk and cycle everywhere, if you choose to?

The government doesn't choose where you live and work, unlike Soviet Russia. Thus, if you say it's "impractical" to cycle that's because of a series of choices that you made and are continuing to make.

If you have the cash to pay for a place that requires a car, you definitely CAN live some place where it's practical to cycle IF YOU CHOOSE.

So it's not luck which got me here. It was a series of pretty easy and obvious choices. If you look for a place to live on foot only then by default you'll wind up in a place where you don't have to drive to.

Plus, if you factor the extra money you save on a car into rent, you can pay more.

But there's more! We don't pay more. In fact, some of the more expensive places cater to automobiles only. In fact, it's been shown that rent is as much as 25% higher due to the price of a mandatory parking spot. If we got rid of this, we'd all be 25% of our rent or housing payment richer! Not to mention the automobile richer.

Plus, think of what happens if you hit someone and go to jail. How practical will your commute be then?

So overall, there's zero luck involved in my lifestyle. I chose it and anyone who has the vast amount of wealth to the part of the tiny percent who can actually afford an auto can join my very non-exculsive club. Also, practical, has no meaning the absolute sense, but only means something when you have all ready decided what to practice.

So if you are going to live in an elite, fancy pants neighborhood, then cycling may look ridiculous. But if you spend a fraction of the time you using waste on oil changes, and insrucance and all that other motoring nonsense, and do the research, you'll discover that no matter what your excuse, you can bicycle.

And if you are so terribly disabled that you can't bicycle, why are driving? Seriously, don't be another statistic and kill someone. I know this sounds harsh, but it's not nearly as harsh as selfishly continuing to drive until someone gets hit, and we collectively throw up our hands and pretent that it was just another preventable accident. It's not.

Have a nice day. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Bufferin Bike Lanes</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/11/30/bufferin-bike-lanes/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Yes, this is a post which is supposed to be a pun on the old school buffered aspirin which anyone will need if they follow this debate.

To bring newcomers up to speed, forces of darkness are receeding, but not fast enough.

All of us want the same thing, even if we don't know it yet: bicycles off the road, out of harms way.

But for every punchbowl, there's a turd, and in this case it goes by the name of VC. (More info is found on my pages on VC and Quisling advocates).

Anyway, the latest battle is waging over buffered bike lanes.

The debate is similar to the kind of argument that would break out when we discover flying carpets. There's always going to be someone who, instead of enjoying the air rush their hair while they sit on the silken carpet, is going to argue whether the flying carpet is really an airplane or a floor covering.

Similarly, we are getting debates on whether a buffered bike lane is really a bike lane at all!

How original.

First of all, what is a buffered bike lane?

<a href="http://bikingrules.org/biking/laneprimer">Here</a> is a good photo:

[caption id="attachment_940" align="aligncenter" width="151" caption="Buffered Bike Lane"]<a href="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/buffered_lane.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-940" title="Buffered Bike Lane" src="http://cyclingunbound.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/buffered_lane.jpg" alt="Buffered Bike Lane" width="151" height="206" /></a>[/caption]

Looks pretty cool, right?

No, because some people are arguing that sticking a bike lane next to a hatch mark makes it not a bike lane at all!

"Bike Lanes  are defined as preferential lanes in Section 3B-22.  A preferential lane is considered a Bike Lane when a 'bike lane' symbol is placed within."

So it is a bike lane.

But why put this in?

<a href="http://www.bicyclecoalition.org/files/Spruce_Pine%20Press%20Release%20Dec10_corrected.doc">Buffered bike lanes have allowed more people to ride their bicycles (warning MS DOC).</a>

In Philadelphia: "Bicycle Usage Up 95% on Spruce and Pine Bike Lanes...During the same time period, the percentage of bicyclists who used the sidewalks on Spruce and Pine Streets fell by 41-75%."

But will this make things more dangerous?

<a href="http://bikeportland.org/2011/05/12/pbot-data-buffered-bike-lanes-lead-to-big-safety-benefits-on-holgate-52885">No, buffered bike lanes make streets safer.</a>

"Prior to the project, PBOT counted approximately 7 injury crashes each year in the corridor. In the full year after the project, PBOT has seen 2 serious injury crashes in the corridor."

But won't this appropriation of the roads lead to anger at cyclists and, in our zero sum world, get our rights to the road taken away?

Not at all. From the above link, it appears that there is a small number of people who hate cyclists. Removing paint from roads will not turn these people into bicycle lovers. Many of them appear to be depressed or angry who's limited ability to control their emotions may put them in jail. Ironically, their anger at cyclists may remove their licenses, and they too will join us out on the streets. (Hey, I can dream of a safer world on my blog). :)

From the same article:

"Overall, Stephen felt like the meeting "represented some good news in the face of that Holladay project and other setbacks lately." His final impression? Of nearby residents, "70% were very happy, 25% probably didn't care, and 5% were noisy and cranky."

Reader Megan wrote in to say some in the crowd weren't just cranky, they were downright rude. "The vocal group last night was extremely disrespectful to anyone who didn't support their point of view," she comments below, "calling out names while people commented and talking loudly during the roll-out of data. They were there to bully and intimidate."

For their part, PBOT project managers Greg Raisman and Mark Lear both felt the meeting went very well. Lear told us the meeting was "amazing" and that there were "more supporters than people in opposition." The primary reason many now support the project are the safety benefits."

Here's a visual where green man is the tiny strips of paint on the road and the little person is the mad 5%:

  <title>Three Foot Passing Law and Human Instincts</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/11/30/three-foot-passing-law-and-human-instincts/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Despite my constant work on my mind--especially when cycling--I still get angry when buzzed.

Getting buzzed is when a motorist passes you too close for comfort. It's like they were going to murder you, but got cold feet at the last minute. The only thing that I hate more than a cold blooded killer is a weakling who fails to follow through. :)

Seriously, I am reading a great book called _Body Language_ by Allan and Barbara Pease.

In it, it talks about comfort zones, including those felt by motorists.

Even in countries where the personal bubble is smaller, three feet is pretty close especially when you are being passed by a highly dangerous lump of steel.

In fact, according to this book, and my experience, the personal zone is between eighteen inches and four feet. This is only less intimate than the intimate zone which is a bit closer.

Thus, the motor vehicle is getting close enough to be a really good friend who is talking with you about something you both like. But this isn't a friend, it's a stranger. Thus, even if you were not on a bicycle and they weren't on a bike, you'd wonder why they got so close to you. In some place, they'd even think you were hitting on them or harassing them.

In a vehicle, it's, of course, more terrifying. Also, in the United States, the distance is on the far end, closer to four feet than to two.

Thus, the three foot passing law allows for cars to get closer to cyclists than humans normally would in social occasions unless the two were close buddies or lovers.

Allowing someone to penetrate you personal space hardly seems to be burdensome.

Also, these are cultural more and animal instincts. In fact, animals that are too crowded have died from stress alone. Thus, to say that this is hard to figure out when you are driving too close to someone goes against the direct experience, culture, and biological programming of a normal human, and it suggests that the person is somehow mentally damaged.

However, many organizations came out against this law for various reasons, but nowhere in the debate did I see that this isn't really a burden, but rather the law is more permissive than good manners and our human brains dictate.

But there's more!

According to the Peases (and other researchers), in a care, people feel that their personal bubble is much larger. In fact, a typical motorist feels entitled to twenty five feet of space in front and in back of their cars. If this space is violated in front, they feel angry due to being "cut off". In the back, they feel "tailgated."

Surely such a person, who demands over EIGHT TIMES the law in space, should find it child's play to estimate three feet of passing space for a cyclist.

In fact, I see this all the time where they get really close to me, a human, just like them. Then they veer off to protect an unfeeling inanimate object of a parked car ahead.

That is, when I drive in the parallel parking area, cars feel compelled to come in and buzz me, but they give parked cars much more room. This is very consistent, and to me bizarre behavior.

But I blame the system more than the motorist. 

This effect has been confirmed by several motorist who, also saw themselves becoming monsters when motoring. This alienation is one of my major complaints about motoring as it is so universal, and in my mind, toxic.

After learning how humans are set up, I think that the three foot passing law is too little, and I think that the people who voted against it need a bit more education (or perhaps introspection) on how their own minds operate.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Economics of Cycling Infrastructure</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/12/01/economics-of-cycling-infrastructure/</link>
  <pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2011 00:36:51 +0000</pubDate>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the most often repeated and dumbest complaints about cycling infrastructure is that "it's a waste of money" and "we can't afford it."

Hearing these poor people complaining, you'd think that they were personally asked to shell out for shiny new footrests and armrests for cyclists, who take up all but one tiny lane, where the sad SUV and truck owners struggle to pass through a single lane which is half in the gutter.

The truth is that not only are we totally rich when it comes to cycling money, it's more expensive to NOT build infrastructure.

Not only that, despite one's complaints, exanding the cyclists "right to the roads" by building more dedicated cycling infrastructure happens to be the law of the land.

For a list of some of the things that Caltrans is doing in order to better accomodate cyclists, we can look at <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CCUQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dot.ca.gov%2Fhq%2Ftraffops%2Fsurvey%2Fpedestrian%2FTR_MAY0405.pdf&amp;ei=sxTYTt-QNYG0iQLc0oWtCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNGUubjJZW84gUu2kyvJL-mQ4GvG9w&amp;sig2=L47wyTjGL1b-ckMfJcIukQ">this document.</a>

Some of my favorite quotes are "New bikeways removing travel barriers to potential bicycle commuters."

Ah, yes, Caltrans, you brute acknowledge the obvious, that one of the biggest barriers to commuting is room on the road to actually commute on.

You may have noticed that in that lovely document, there was a mention of traffic calming. Why would we want to do that?

Because it prevents traffic accidents which are <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/03/05/news/economy/AAA_study/">expensive.</a>

Each of us has a cost of $1000 per year as estimated by AAA, for traffic accidents, if we equally had to pay for accidents, which we do not. In reality, it's the victims of traffic accidents who have to pay the lion's share of the cost in terms of hospitalization, disability, <a href="http://gothamist.com/2011/11/30/nypds_handling_of_traffic_crash_inv.php#photo-1">and so on.</a>

Thus the point of traffic calming isn't so much as to help cyclists, but it's to make the entire neighborhood safer. This happens to reduce accidents and save lots of money.

Also, there's the whole notion of oil dependence that our last president spoke about. How much is it really, though?

Only about a <a href="http://www.wnd.com/?pageId=44497">billion bucks</a> a day. :)

Imagine if we had a fraction of this money and spent it on cycling? Once the oil is burned, you have to buy it all over again, but cycling infrastructure can last years if it's well made, and you don't drive heavy vehicles on it as we are wont to do.

There's much more, but I'm a busy guy, so let's talk health care costs which are skyrocketing. Why so high?

Mainly because people are getting older in a system that can artificially keep them alive, but people aren't doing their part and taking care of themselves.

Not only that, but in our desperate desire to have perfect safety, we are literally giving our children obesity and diabetes. This problem is one thing that programs like Safe Routes to School seeks to address.

Right now one out of five children are obese. One out of three are either obese or merely fat.

In 2000, 
<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/health/reports/child_obesity/">the total cost of obesity</a> for children and adults in the United States was estimated to be $117 billion ($61 billion in direct medical costs).

So there you have it. A hundred billion here, and a hundred billion there, and soon you are talking about making every city as bikable as Copenhagen.

So the next time that someone says that we can't possibly afford that fancy pants, elitist cycle tracks ask them how well they are doing with those billions of bucks that they are pouring down the drain, enervating the US economically, health-wise, and militarily, and generally making the world a less pleasant place to live in.

After all, it's kind of sad that I even have to make an economic argument as I believe that it's more important to make things better first.

That is, to spend a little more money and have healthier and happier people.

It just happens to work out the opposite way. You spend a bit more now, have healthier and happier people AND pocket a shit ton of hard cold cash.

Here's one more place I want my cake and eat it too!

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Yes, my commute often gets lonely because there is usually nobody around.

However, there's one guy who passes me many times, who always says hello. I have gone on some rides with him, but never got to know him well.

Also, there are the various other cyclists I see.

A few days ago, I caught up to a cyclist, which is really rare.

Usually, I pass someone first, so I don't startle them, then I turn and say "hi".

However, my princess has given me detailed lessons on how the do's and don't's of talking to strange women in the streets. Thus, in general, I only say "hi" when it's appropriate.

This time, it wasn't so I stayed silent.

I was hoping to pass the cyclist so I didn't freak her out.

Imagine riding, alone, on a dark road and some guy trails you. Not good.

Unfortunately, our paces were perfectly matched when it came to climbing. Perhaps it was due to the fact that my chain was messed up as stated in an earlier post.

Also, she had no back nor front light which is kind of dangerous on this road. Thus, it wasn't totally bad with my front light illuminating the road and my back blinky (hopefully) seen by cars.

One thing that thrilled me was that she had two largish panniers which meant that she was probably on tour. Cool! But still no reason to be annoying so I squelched the urge to ask her the usual questions that tourers get so sick of answering.

Then my friend, Mike, rode by me yelling his usually, "hi".

"Hi, Mike," I said.

The girl turned and asked me what I said. I told her that I was talking to Mike.

She didn't comprehend me, and she said a bunch of other stuff.

I didn't hear anything because the road was so noisy. Also, the bike lane got really narrow in places which prevented me from riding next to her.

Finally, we got out of the valley and up to the (a little bit) quieter City Heights.

We chatted for a bit at each light. She asked if her light was out, and I told her that it was. Also, we discussed her tour a little. Finally, I sensed she might need some help so I offered.

She politely declined. "I'm meeting some friends who are waiting for me." 

That's a really good answer though perhaps not true.

Still, I don't blame her for not coming over though in touring it's less uncommon than you would think.

When I got home, I recounted the story to my princess. The first thing she asked is, "Did you invite her over?"

Haha, she, too, was excited to meet someone on tour which is always a rare sight even in San Diego which is the terminus of many East and West tours and a stop on many North and South ones.

We love tourers so much, we are even contemplating getting a bigger place so we can put some up, comfortably. :)]]></content:encoded>

It's been a while for us, but we finally went back to lovely Mexico for Paseo de Todos.

Once again, the motorists were mighty kind, much kinder than Americans its "Finest City" which strives to "stay classy" and thus Mexican motorists are fine indeed.

The ride was fun, but (luckily) this time, fairly uneventful.

I spent a lot of time talking to my friends about how great the ride is.

Also, I realized that riding in Tijuana at night is a lot like ice skating. It smells the same as the Zamboni. The air is actually cold--similar in temperature to skating. Thus, one should definitely button up. Just because it's Mexico does not mean that it's going to be warm at night. In fact, it was cooler than many places in San Diego so be warned. Also, it felt a bit like skating because we were cycling. The only big difference is that I didn't have the lame-ass butterflies in my stomach that I had when I was a teenager as the main purpose of ice skating is to hook up with the other skaters. :)

After the ride, we went to a taco stand where we got yelled at for drinking on the street. Oops. I don't follow a lot of rules, but I definitely make it a habit to follow all the laws in a foreign country.

Then we went back to the hotel for the usual late night conversation like we do with all close friends who don't have narcolepsy. :)

The discussion was very good especially when we revealed our findings of the faked data of the Cross study which I had mentioned in other posts.

It was really, really awesome to hang out with people who understood the significance of this immediately. Contrast this with people who continue to make up their own version of reality and call the rest of us who actually read studies "superstitious."

These kinds of things are seen in a book I mentioned before, _You Are Not Smart_. I got it from the library, and I started reading it.
It's fun to read, but pretty depressing. On the other hand, since I am working on humility this week, it's a good for me.

Anyway, the next day, we took a long walk around Mexico, with our bicycles. We found the holy grail of food which is Chinese-Mexican which we'll try next time.

Since we got lost--but it wasn't scary at all--getting home required us to cross this strange Mad Max style pedestrian bridge with no sides on the stairs. They just let you fall one story if you slip.

It crossed this large cement slab of a river which had a tiny trickle of water in it.

Finally, we had to wait in line for a long, long time. The pedestrian line snaked back really far. But it seemed to go fast as the local entertainment was quite good.

I can't wait to go back.

  <title>The Three E's</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="614" caption="Blank Slate for Bicycle Control Gadgets"]<img class=" " title="Blank Slate for Bicycle Control Gadgets" src="http://i1143.photobucket.com/albums/n631/fredollinger/CIMG2864-1.jpg" alt="Blank Slate for Bicycle Control Gadgets" width="614" height="461" />[/caption]

The other night, a good friend of mine told me about the three E's of cycling promotion: Engineering, Education, and Enforcement.

I was immediately excited about this because I have never heard of this, but I work with a lot of engineers, and my job title is nominally an engineer. Finally, I really like letter games, and the Three E's sounded cool.

Obviously, since I am into engineering, eductation and enfocement kind of bore me. It's not that they are totally unimportant or anything, but knowing myself and other engineers, we really don't care too much for the other two E's because engineers love to talk gadgets.

Since I design user interfaces, I see things in terms of widgets like the buttons on this screen that can be clicked with your mouse. I see the road in a similar way--like a vast UI.

Thus engineers see things in terms of constant improvement. All the engineers I know who bicycle can think of many, many ways the road can be improved for cyclists. Even when improvements cause problems, most of us would actually like to add something to the design rather than to resign themselves to failure.

Another thing about the engineers I know is that we don't think too much about safety. However, we don't go out of our ways to be unsafe, we just don't think of it because we are too excited making new gadgets to worry about that.

For example, a friend of mine was able to put together a magnet which spun very quickly on his desk. Only did his boss notice that this might be dangerous. But the boss being an engineer, too, didn't get emotional, but rather he said very calmly, "be careful with that." That is, he was OK with his employee playing with high speed magnets in his office as long as he was careful.

Thus, if we're directed to make things safer as part of the design specification, we'll do it.

For example, many people say that streets are dangerous. I analyzed this and looked at the statistics, and I realized that getting hit from behind was the highest risk of injury. Many things are being done to address this such as bike lanes. However, there's still the fear of getting either hit from behind when drivers make a right turn or getting hit by the side via the right hook. Overall, these are pretty equivelent collisions, and both can be solved by a simple method.

Instead of having slower bicycles merge with traffic, which is quite dangerous, cyclists should go straight, only. This will totally eliminate getting hit from behind and save a lot of lives. There still is the problem of getting right hooked by distracted motorists--damned engineers who make gadgets. :)

My solution to this problem is of course, another gadget. We should have lights that activate for the cyclist only. Right turns for cars will be allowed only when they get a right turn green arrow. Thus both problems are solved.

Now the only time someone will get hit will be when they break the law. Thus gadgets make safety better and rely on ENFORCEMENT less, though, of course, we still will need enforcement. The difference with my gadget is that in the past many cyclists who FOLLOWED THE LAW were killed. This should reduce this number.

Finally, motorists are going to need to learn something which is really easy to pick up, thus, the gadget will make EDUCATION, no unnecessary, but less important and much easier.

Think of how quick people went from not knowing what an iPhone was to being experts at zoom and scrolling. Similarly, the streets are a vast UI which can be ENGINEERED to make it easy to use for all of us.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Cycling Biases</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[One of my current favs is McRaney whom I mentioned earlier as the author of _You Are Not So Smart_.

In his book, he covers a great number of cognitive biases and logical fallacies.

I'd like to cover some in the cycling world.

For those of you who came for pom-poms and gumdrops in the cycling world, and those who are sick of conflict and drama, you may skip this post.

I'm going to go over, once again, the insane obsession that some cyclists have for "taking the lane" as well as taking the English language and torturing it like it's 2003. "I'm driving my bicycle." (sic)

Now to make this more fun, I'll post the quote, and reader will try to guess which logical fallacy is there. Note, though there might be more than one, I'll write about one per quote. If you find a different, you still get credit.

"This is an example of what results from what John F. refers to as the "policy of promoting incompetent cycling on bikeways".  This beloved Long Beach side path does exactly that... it encourages incompetent cycling on bikeways."

This is the just world theory, the notion that the world should be fair. The 70's and 80's sucked for cycling which had motorists spitting on cyclists, the lowest ridership ever, and bad hair.

Now that things are getting better for cyclists, the older crew want us to suffer like they did. They especially don't want people who are ignorant to get on their bicycle and be safe and to have fun. That wouldn't be fair! Because we aren't suffering as much as they did. Why should we reap the rewards of cycling without the pain of a little gobbing?

Exhibit Two:

"I rode 48 miles around San Diego yesterday, including all the complete circumference of San Diego Bay. Facilities are of an uneven nature, to be sure. But, riding on bicycle only facilities is the least satisfying."

This is called the cognitive bias of expectation. McRaney talks about wine tasters who thought that wines in a better bottle actually tasted better.

Surprise! We used the same wine in every experiment. "Red" wine was actually white wine died red!

Similarly when Coca Cola drinkers were given the "Pepsi Challenge", they often said that Pepsi tasted better. When they were told that they were actually tasting Pepsi, they changed their minds. When put into an MRI, Coke drinkers' pleasure centers lit up. When told that they were drinking Pepsi, they started to squelch the natural pleasure that their brains felt!

So people who hate infrastructure, will NEVER enjoy it unless they engage in Prozac, cognitive therapy, and meditation. I feel that I can point them in the right direction to a happier life, but they won't allow me to help.

Sigh.

Exhibit Three:

There's a huge debate over whether getting rear ended is number one or number two in the highest number of injuries.

Normal people don't care, they like to be protected from ALL injuries.

But due to the fact that some people think that riding in the middle of a high speed lane will magically make a cyclist nearly immune to injury, the notion that they are vulerable to injury must be denied.

And it is.

In fact, if you give these people an article which proves that traffic engineers, by specifically thinking about making these safer for cyclists, can do just that, these people will not see it.

This form of metal blindness is especially entertaining in the Unbound household, and it gives us hours of fascination, conversation, and laughter.

"'And I don't think I have to mention this, but I will - a bicycle is much smaller and much less visible than an automobile and thus more prone to getting rear ended.' You didn't present any evidence for this conclusion, so it must be anecdotal."

If you guessed pure idiocy, you'd be right. However, the point I was getting at here was confirmation bias. Information that helps your case you believe without question. If your point of view is questioned, you throw out the data.

In this case, the person was able to convince himself the notion that a bicycle is smaller than an auto is absurd as is the notion that a smaller object is harder to see than a larger one, and the idea that one is more likely to collide with something harder to see.

Exhibit Four:

"You cannot present any studies supporting your presumption that cycle tracks and separated facilities are safer for bicyclists, because none exists...I would really prefer to educate (a very cheap solution) and enforce the current laws (potentially bearing revenue) before suggesting the implementation of the costlier forms of bicycle infrastructure (shared paths, cycle tracks)."

And the fallacy is...brand loyalty.

"Cycling education" is a brand, and those who have been advocating would look stupid, if their favorite product were suddenly obsolete just like the DOS users whined when MacOS (R) and Windows TM came and let the great unwashed use their computers without constantly referring to gurus.

Brand loyalty is a series of fallacies.

One of them is sunk cost which shows the longer you stump for something, the more likely you are to defend that choice even when it looks stupid.

This is because people love to protect their egos.

This is one reason people stay with an abusive partner, and why some people rate deadly, noisy, smelly roads as "hedonically better" than quiet and safe ones.

I, myself, am starting to love my abuser. Kiss me Fairmount with your smog covered lips.

Also, cyclists who consider themselves "educated" over-rate this education by the endowment effect (fallacy). Those who have something will rate it as more valuable than anyone else.

Exhibit five:

This one is the best.

"The main skill set is what I call defensive riding. This comes from motorcycle riding (I have been riding motorbikes for 20 years). When you ride a motorbike, you are much more exposed. You are operating in an environment where most people are protected by a cage, but you are not. People protected by a cage, like car drivers, tend not to be as carefully as they should around you simply because the risk to THEM is much lower than the risk to YOU. So you need to take extra precaution. You don’t ride a motorbike like you drive a car. Here are some essential motorcycle survival skills that I believe can be useful to cyclists:"

This is Narcisism, the notion that we are all somehow special and smarter than everyone else.

The truth is that we are all fallible, and knowledge and experience can only take us so far.

There's the bonus fallacy of the illusion of control.

In reality, accidents are usually random, and though there are some things we can do to stop them; we can never, on our own, perfectly control the world.

This is why we need to help one another as much as possible, and to unload most of our efforts into infrastructure created by experts.

I'll stop here.

How well did you do at finding fallacies?

0 - Jersey Shore Cast Reject

1 - Toddler Self-Helper

2 - Sophomore Philosopher

3 - Budding Logician

4 - Hyper-aware (of other's fallacies)

5 - Over Read Zealot

So what's the way out?

Personally, I have tossed out all pretense of logic and reason unless I want to stump someone who thinks that they're Spock. :)

I realize that all my notions are based on biases, emotions, and whims.

And as Brand said, "If we create our own reality...which we do, why not see endless beauty?"

Why not indeed.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[OK, this is a tired and tortured topic, but we continue to see guff about this nonsense, so I figured I'd find some backup. 

Just a warning for those who wanted more on meditation or me waxing fondly on past bike rides in lovely places...

As I posted last week, I'm both in engineering (software) and am geek.

I love a good piece of data analysis.

Thus, when I heard that "bike lanes were inherently unsafe", my mouth watered.

"Et tu, Brute," I thought.

Then, rememebered the speech I had heard that the US has really high road standards, much higher than the Netherlands. Despite this, we have more road deaths. Thus, standards are not the problem.

"But what are those standards?" I wondered.

I did what I do whenever I have these problems, I ask my guru then I spam mailing lists with his musings as well as my own anecdotes and speculations.:)

Just kidding.

I do a five minute google search.

This gave me a world of data, the coolest being a piece of software called HAT: Hazard Analysis Tool. This can all be found in this excellent <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CFYQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Frebar.ecn.purdue.edu%2FRoad_School%255CNagle.pdf&amp;ei=2FvmTp3dFeiniQLk07C7Bg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFLEXgFeZCSxRHUDcG6CfkrlrCYzw&amp;sig2=J0ju6GCdbtDyG_jjc1k8lg">talk (pdf).</a>

From the talk, HAT is "designed to Justify Safety Projects."

It has a "module to assist in documenting problems
and determining mitigation."

To get a copy talk to Purdue which owns the copyright.

There is a "Federal Requirement that all states evaluate their highway system for the 5% of locations that exhibit the highest Safety Needs Emphasis on Fatal and Incapacitating Injuries."

Thus, if any bike infrastructure turns out to be hazardous, it will, by federal law, be fixed soon.

What does unsafe mean according to US DOT? 

"Locations are qualified to be on the 5% that meet two conditions: location must experience two events of a Fatal or Incapacitating Injury (icc) and locations are then ranked by Icc. Locations are chosen until 5% of the Fatal and Incapacitating Injuries are represented."

But bike lanes are still unnecessary, right? They are an extra liability and a gray area?

Wrong.

According to a US DOT policy satatement each local traffic planning agency must: 

"Define the exceptional circumstances in which facilities for bicyclists and pedestrians will NOT be required in all transportation projects."

That is, by law, the onus is on those who need to prove that we should NOT build bike infrastructure. We need to figure this out, separately, and to argue, separately, each piece of infrastructure.

"Adopt new manuals, or amend existing manuals, covering the geometric design of streets, the development of roadside safety facilities, and the design of bridges and their approaches so that
they comprehensively address the development of bicycle and pedestrian facilities as an integral element of the design of all new and reconstructed roadways."

This means that we not only CAN innovate, but, by federal law, we must, if it's necessary to accomodate non-motorized transportation.

Again, this can be found with <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CB0QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dot.ca.gov%2Fhq%2Ftraffops%2Fsurvey%2Fpedestrian%2FTR_MAY0405.pdf&amp;ei=FV7mTpX-LOLfiAKYn4WiBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNGUubjJZW84gUu2kyvJL-mQ4GvG9w&amp;sig2=LLbxfqgzLr6ShpvUQ2sx6A">google.</a>

There's much more online if one would spend the time to google.

The take home message is that streets must accomodate all modes, by federal and state (CA) law. Anyone who disagrees must find a particular reason for a single street on why this is an exception. The burden of proof is on those who do NOT want infrastructure.

There's nothing in the code about continuing to allow cyclists to "take the lane" nor is there anything to indicate that bike facilities are harmful to cyclists. Also, there's nothing to show that building facilities will take rights away.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Chat Bot</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Most mornings in the Unbound household are similar in that we talk about cycling advocacy.

Unfortunately, we're foolish enough to allow some of the naysayer's arguments to invade the discussion.

Who are these naysayers? Are they the oil companies, the AAA, the Hummer Union, or insane fundamentalists?

None of the above unless you consider Quisling cyclists to be part of the whole insane fundamentalist posse which I certainly do.

The latest in their religion is that on time, instead of harping on safety because study after study shows that their superior riding style (sic) is crazy dangerous compared to normal cycling, they have tossed the whole notion of safety under the bus and are now obsessed with their "rights to the road".

What does this mean? This means that they feel that "taking the lane" is a fundamental Human Right just like freedom of speech, the internet, and food.

Scratch that last one. Due to their mainly libertarian bent, they are more concerned with riding in the road rights than they are to feed starving people. Not at all selfish. :)

At any rate, how are we going to deal with their daily, nightmarish vomit of text?

My suggestion is, of course, an engineering one aka software engineering.

We should make a chat bot which will answer our email screeds for us.

To be fair, and since it's on the table as an excercise in empathy, the Unbounds agreed that they were going to create a Vehicular Cyclist apologist chat bot first.

The notion is to search the mailing list for key words such as "travel lane" and to respond with witty VCisms such as "always ride in the center of the travel lane."

If someone dies, chat bot says, "If he rode VC, he'd be here with his family today."

When people begin to question the chat bot's sanity (and humanity), it will say something like, "Why you say I no human?"

If people don't get this joke soon enough, we'll toss in "clues" such as "Error in troll.py line 156: Can't find stupid-arguments.txt."

Future version will have the ability to go online with key words in order to find "relevant" articles to post to the group based on keywords in previous posts and other key words we'll toss in there.

This should be pretty easy to whip up since the pro-VC posts are pretty much the same ten (or less) ideas. I'll leave out the whole personal attacks and glorying in deaths (for the most part) because if this poor bot gets banned, I want it to for a good reason and not because he broke the posting rules.

We'll leave the really inhuman comments to flesh and blood humans. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Great Risk to the (cycling) Environment is Environmentlists?</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Sometimes, cyclists are accused of being environmentalists which is usually not really true.

That is, most environmentalists don't really think of cycling as a "practical" choice for their cause.

To me this is hilarious for many reasons outlined before, but the main one being that, with the wealth of Midas, we don't live in Soviet Russia. That is, if you can afford to have a car, you can afford not to.

But why is it that we believe, so badly, that we do need to own cars?

One of the biggest reason is the American dream, owning one's own home.

Not only is it important to have a place of one's own, but one needs to have a place that's a minature country estate.

The funny thing about living in the country, in contrast to city living, is that the more people who move there, the more the country sucks. In fact, the more people who move there, the less of the country it is and the more like suburbs.

In order to preserve this awesome "country living" (snore), people have taken drastic measures to preserving their isolation.

One of them has been pointed out in the excellent book, _Reluctant Metropolis_ by William Fulton.

In it, Fulton talks about how LA (and other places) sprawl is caused, in part, by people wanting all to live out in the country. As silly as it is, as LA is NOT the country in most places, people are STILL trying to preserve their way of life.

So it is there, it is in San Diego county.

That is why <a href="http://www.nctimes.com/news/local/escondido/escondido-campaign-launched-to-preserve-acres-west-of-daley-ranch/article_12d45ea2-67be-5a8d-bd81-61e4cead62d1.html">this story</a> angered me so much.

It's not that I don't like people to live out where they want to live, but part of this whole thing is for people who have chosen to live out in the country to keep it that way under the guise of "environmentalism".

This is pure twaddle because if an area does NOT urbanize then you here the lame-ass excuse that "things are too far for me to bike", "biking is dangerous", and "biking is not practical."

All of this really means is that the powers that be made things that way.

Now instead of fighting this, and focusing on cycling and city living, both of which have a smaller footprint on the environment, we are instead wasting time protecting the property values of people who spent too much for their homes.

That's right, some of this so-called environmentalism is just a way for people to keep their own personal environment pristine while living a life which exports their damage to other parts of the world.

I have a big stake in this because as a decade long resident of Philadelphia, I was well aware of the parasitic attitude suburbanites have of the city. They love to brag about how they are from this really big city, but in reality they never go there. Most wealthy suburbs are the products of successful cities which ought to be glorified as the antecedents to _civilization_ but instead problems such as homeless and stadiums are relegated to the city while the suburbanites try to hold back the tax money they have produced in a large part by the city that they scorn.

It gets worse. From the article:

"John Weil, chief of staff for County Supervisor Pam Slater-Price, said Friday that the acreage is quality habitat worth exploring as mitigation land that developers could buy in exchange for destroying nature elsewhere."

So they aren't even going to preserve the environment, but rather use the land to mitigate guilt as well as legal requirements for other developments! Ug, this just makes me want to scream!

I'm actually not against preserving green spaces nor to I hate the environment. 

I just hate it when people aren't totally honest with their intentions.

If you want your area to look natural and beautiful, I am in favor of this.

However, I really hate to see the notion of actually realizing the Earth, like everything else, has a carrying capacity and that resources are limited conflated with making a home in nature.

Living in nature is the anti-thesis of environmentalism.

If you care for nature, live in a small apartment on weekends and commute by bicycle. You can take public transportation out to the nature you preserved by not building a house on it.]]></content:encoded>

Longtime readers know that I had previously had been fixing my bicycle.

I am happy to announce that it's almost (that's right almost) done!

I have only to tune the gears which is something that I have a lot of (painful) practice with.

Last night, it was the icing on the cake.

I finally got my crank arm extractor tool. I got the good one, but it still only cost $17 which is well worth having a tool I'll use over and over again.

Using it was easy. Just take off the outer nut with a hextool. Note that I needed to use a hammer on this. Thankfully, this and the rest of the job followed the usual counter-clockwise pattern.

One I banged this open, I screwed in the crank arm extractor. Again, I needed to use a hammer. The directions try to scare you because they say that if you don't get it 100% screwed in, you will damage threads. This was not true for me. I could not bang it in all the way so I just gave up and moved on.

The next step has us screw in the smaller inner nut on crank arm extractor. This needed a hammer as well. I failed before because I failed to realize that more force is OK.

Finally, the crank arm just came off. What a blessed relief.

Getting the other one on was easy. However, my front derailler was improperly installed. Intead of fixing it like I should have, I got princess to held jimmy it into place.

Finally, I took changed my pedal which was easy.

The next day when I went to ride, I realized a few things.

First was that pedals are supposed to be 180 degrees apart by mine were more like 30 degrees. The crank arm will go on all wrong if you are dumb enough, like me, to do so. 

It was funny almost falling off my bike because I could not pedal.

So I had a rushed mess the next morning. Fortunately, I knew how to do all this so it was easy.

When I got things hooked up, I realized that my derailler was getting damaged because it was too long. I should not have jimmied things last night. So I raised this which was easy, too, just a hex nut.

Finally, I had it all together.

With no time to tune derailler, I still have second gear only, but it's much, much faster with the new, strong teeth of the front (and back) cassettes!

I'm so happy.

  <title>A Crash Report You'll Never See</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/12/20/a-crash-report-youll-never-see/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I decided to make up an imaginary crash report because I'm sick of the double standard in the media.

Note that this is NOT real, and I pray, everyday, almost continuously, actually for the good will, success in life, and health of nearly every motorist that passes me on the street. Details are in prior blog posts.

Here we go:

This just in, a Nissan 350Z rolled over and crushed its occupants. Mr. and Mrs. Unbound were crushed shortly after getting rear ended by a Greyhound. 

They were not wearing helmets nor were they wearing any bright flourescent colors. I'm not saying they _deserved_ to die due to their dress code, but the SUV was black which is obviously harder to see.
er
Thus, their death was in some way a tragedy of the father of four, Mr. Chabot, who had never been in an accident before.

"They just came out of nowhere," he said. "I was driving down the freeway one moment then the next, they were in the way!"

Crash analysis shows that the deceased had probably been driving the speed limit, however, many are quoted as saying that the median speed was much higher.

"You'd have to be insane to drive the speed limit on that road," said one anonymous person.

A crash expert noted that less than 1% of people who died in traffic accidents were wearing helmets. 

"Car helmets really save lives," he said. "If they had been wearing helmets, they might be with their family today."

Furthermore, it's known that the 350Z is the most dangerous vehicle in its class..

"You would have to be crazy to take your life in your own hands. You have a 35x higher chance at dying."

"(In a thirty-five m.p.h. crash test, for instance, the driver of a Cadillac Escalade—the G.M. counterpart to the Lincoln Navigator—has a sixteen-per-cent chance of a life-threatening head injury, a twenty-per-cent chance of a life-threatening chest injury, and a thirty-five-per-cent chance of a leg injury. The same numbers in a Ford Windstar minivan—a vehicle engineered from the ground up, as opposed to simply being bolted onto a pickup-truck frame—are, respectively, two per cent, four per cent, and one per cent. ) "

http://www.lilith-ezine.com/articles/automotive/SUVs-Are-Dangerous.html

Others have noted that they feel that while they are sad the couple is dead, SUV owners tend to be smug.

"According to Bradsher, internal industry market research concluded that S.U.V.s tend to be bought by people who are insecure, vain, self-centered, and self-absorbed, who are frequently nervous about their marriages, and who lack confidence in their driving skills."

One of the biggest contributing factors to the couple's death besides the poor vehicle choice, lack of bright colors, lack of helmet was the relatively small size of the vehicle.

"Let's face it, the roads are dangerous," said one expert. "If you drive a small vehicle like an SUV, you are taking your life into your own hands because you will not fare well if you get hit by a bus or semi."

Another noted, "The couple could have taken the Greyhound and they would be alive. Instead they took the risk and jumped in a smaller vehicle and paid the price."

Nobody is saying that it's their fault, but logic states when two vehicles collide, the bigger one wins. Thus, they should have been in the bigger vehicle. This is not a value just a law of physics.

Some say that road safety standards should be higher, but the government disagrees.

One source said, "The roads are for big trucks and buses. Sure tiny SUVs can 'share the road', but we aren't liable if they get hurt."]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Concerned About Concerns</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This is another <a href="http://john-s-allen.com/blog/?p=820">nonsensical debate</a> in the swirl of endless argument over things that have been resolved for decades in more civilized parts of the world.

Instead of doing experiments and looking at data, we are concerned.

How very generous of you.

Well, one thing my princess loves about me is that though I have trained myself to have a facade of a nice person and to not argue with everyone over everyone--though I am silently judging you, yes you! :)--I do love to argue.

While she gets worn out and sick of it, I can keep going--not with her, though, we never argue--ad museum until my heart gives out.

Thus, I'll rehash this hot mess again!

"One-way cycle tracks trade the perception of increased safety between intersections, for a documented increase in bicycle-involved collisions at intersections due to through-right conflicts"

Note the false duality right off the bat? We can either REALLY be safe or have a PERCEPTION of safety. Notice that our perceptions are often completely wrong.

I have found, in my life, that this is usually not correct. When I feel safe, I usually am. When I feel like I am in danger, I know it.

I have had a queasy feeling right before each bicycle collision, mugging, and bar room fight. (Just kidding about the last one). :)

The only exception to this is statistically speaking. But these stats are really, really long shots. For example, the difference between flying and driving. Scratch that, I'm actually more afraid when I drive, and guess what? I'm right on that one, too.

Yes, sometimes ghettos are safe and people get shot by their loved ones in their "safe" feeling home.

But overall, we can feel safe and be safe all at the same time.

"Without intersection priority for bicyclists — either a bike-only signal phase or a bicycle head-start phase — combined with restriction of right-turn-on-red, there is no way to remove this hazard from cycle-track designs."

Wrong!

There's nothing magical about a cycle track that increases intersection risk. This is total nonsense.

Someone who pays attention while riding on an unsafe road with no infrastructure will NOT suddenly stop paying attention when there's a cycle track.

When I rode in cycle tracks, I always looked over my shoulder for the right hook.

The only difference is that nobody tried to do it in Denmark.

Contrast here with NO infrastructure, I have near misses all the time.

Also, the traffic light adjustments are part of infrastructure. So you can't say that infrastructure is unsafe then point out light design or something else and say we need this otherwise your design is unsafe. 

No, the design is one piece which IS safer. John knows that and he's just playing word games because he hates infrastructure.

Note I'm skipping a lot of this because there's too much to cover. If you think I missed something big, I'll argue that later.

"A sidewalk-level bicycle facility, whether 1-way or 2-way, will generate frequent driveway conflicts"

No! No! No!

I "take the lane" each day because of three big conflicts with driveways.

There is no bike infrastructure.

Adding paint and some cycle tracks would make the situation BETTER not worse.

Remember John is going to make up an imaginary situation with a retarded person designing the fixes. This is an insult to American traffic engineers. They will do a good job of mitigating any potential problems.

If they don't get it totally perfect the first time, we'll run HAT analysis on it, and 2.0 will be better. 

Today I saw wreckage of a CAR accident at this dangerous driveway. John, what magic did the engineers do when they failed to provide anything for bicycles to make this safe?

They didn't.

There are thousands of dangerous intersections in the US right now. They are all within code and blah, blah, blah. Yet we lose 3000 people a month due to these legal and non-cycling oriented designs.

"Cycle tracks do not allow cyclists to properly prepare for vehicular-style left turns at intersections"

"Vehicular style left turns" are idiotic and dangerous and ought to be discouraged.

"In the Netherlands, such turns are prohibited for bicyclists; a bicycle-specific signal phase enables bicyclists to turn left from the right side without motor vehicle conflicts. This greatly increases total signal cycle time and consequently average delay for all users."

No! I was not in the Netherlands, but in car oriented Southern Californian, lights take way longer than in cycling Denmark.

In Philly and other big cities which are not totally car oriented, lights take less time.

The more car oriented you make a place, the bigger the intersections and the longer the signals because of left arrows, etc.

So this is totally false.

6. "Urban cycle tracks that run behind busy bus stops have high incidences of pedestrian-bicycle conflicts and collisions."

No they don't.

7. "If the vehicular part of the street is not narrowed, including potential removal of on-street vehicle parking, adding cycle tracks in the sidewalk area takes away width for walking and other uses such as trees, seating, and cafés."

Yes, infrastructure for cycling takes up space. Wow, what a genius.

Quick, John, what's the biggest public space right now?

The answer is vehicular traffic and parking. If you want to advocate for that then come out of the closet. Otherwise, stop pretending to be a cycling advocate.

I care about motorists, too, but not in such a bull headed way. I want to give them transportation options, to keep up good traffic throughput, and to make their trips safer. Cycle tracks accomplish all those goals.

Most motorists do NOT like parallel parking. They park parallel only when they feel there are no other options. The fact is there is a glut of parking in all major cities.

Again, such a nonsensical argument suggests that we only care about suppressing infrastructure.

"8. Perhaps most importantly, because of the limited width available in any streetscape cross section, I fear that many agencies would remove on-street bicycle travel width (bike lanes or shareably-wide outside lanes) if sidewalk-level (“cycle track”) facilities were installed. Do you want to see narrow outside lanes on the streets you now ride?"

Yes, I do.

You fear many agencies and a lot of other things. 

I fear that such nonsensical ideas have been taken seriously for far too long.

I don't know where you live, but Denmark is an OLD country with some narrow streets. They accommodated bicycles in many cities if not all.

How come in more modern places, we can not do the same?

It's all a matter of priorities.

It's not up to the advocate to find "concerns" or other reason NOT ot do things. That's for other people to say.

It's up to advocates to push for things, politicians and other motorists to resist, engineers to worry about the technical ptoblems, and to lawyers, only, to worry about liability issues.

If you are coming up with nonsensical reasons why we can't do good cycling design, you are not a cycling advocate nor a decent engineer.

Things will be designed differently everywhere just as freeways have been adapted to each country.

"Many cycle track advocates assert that they are the only way the U.S. can hope to achieve northern-European bike mode shares, or even double-digit mode shares..."

No. I have not heard a single advocate say this.

I enjoyed riding on cycle tracks, and I am very much in favor of seeing more of them in San Diego. However, it's not up to me what to put where. Again, that's up to the engineers to decide.

I do know, however, that there are no good objections to them in many place, but still there's this annoying yammering about them due to people's insane fears of anything new or from Europe.

"Denmark’s own roads agency has published a report, which I can send you, that ranks the effectiveness of various engineering, education, enforcement and encouragement measures in increasing bicycle mode share. Car parking restrictions and fuel pricing (i.e. making motoring less convenient) ranked higher than cycle tracks."

I am in favor of all of these, but it seems that Quisling advocates oppose any extra regulation of motoring even when it has been proven to save lives and to promote cycling.

I have noticed that one of the myriad of tricks that Quisling advocates have pulled is "divide and conquer". This means that they take all the pieces from a comprehensive program and they point out that they will not be as effective if the entire program is not implemented.

For example, they argue that new infrastructure will be hard to use because we are not educated. Then they argue against education of new how to use the infrastructure because it's not safe because people aren't educated.

Then they argue against the entire program on legalistic or procedural grounds.

To summarize, Quisling advocates are racers who are highly uneducated about cycling infrastructure.

They spread misinformation masked as "concerns" regarding it because they hate dedicated cycing infrastructure.

There are many reasons for this including brand loyalty. If cycling infrastructure becomes mainstream then their "style" of riding will be obsolete.

Many are racers who like to ride in traffic because it gives them a rush. Others sincerely believe, due to misrepresentation of studies such as Ken Cross's, that infrastructure is dangerous.

The are totally immune to learning new things due to the sunk cost fallacy as well as confirmation biases.

Arguging with them is totally pointless, but can be a lot of fun if you don't have much else going on in your life.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for cherry picking a tiny point on my post and totally ignoring the rest of it.

Here are some cool points from the study:

"The increase in injuries is especially large among females
under 20 years of age on foot and bicycle, as well as female pedestrians over the
age of 64."

This is is stupid. We can't look at absolute increases in injuries only relative increase.

In many places no women ride. At all.

Therefore if women feel safe enough to ride the number of absolute injuries will increase. If I get more people wood working, we'll see more people getting splinters.

However, these same women were protected from traffic accidents:

"On the other hand, there was a considerable fall in injuries among older
cyclists and children in cars of both sex."

Note the percentage was not given for some reason so we can't see how many lives cycle tracks saved.

Also, I didn't see anything on fatalities nor did I see how bad the injuries were. 

Tell me John, when we make safer streets do we combine cuts and scrapes with fatalities?

Please read my post on HAT to begin your journey to the notion of safe streets. Then follow the links and read about this.

Also, if we are going to talk stats, let's ask if the changes were statistically significant:

"The construction of cycle lanes has resulted in an increase in accidents of 5% and
15% more injuries. These increases are not statistically significant."

No they were not.

Good day.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Here's some more news from the Complete Streets meeting.

We were last seen talking about the challenge of making room for cycling on streets. 

Someone noted that the last thing one wanted to do was to remove on street parking. 

Personally, I hate to look at things through this lens of a "loss" of parking, but rather to think in terms of what we are gaining.

Someone suggested that other cities should emulated Fresno and to hire an official sales expert to sell cycling and road diets. Of course, I feel that's totally brilliant.

Also, we spoke of the usual notion of asking for more than we think we'll actually get rather than starting with what we think that they will think is "fair" then backing away.

We also talked about the three speed limits: the one designed for, the one posted, and what people actually drive.

Then we talked about that not only are engineers free of the chains of following the "law and code" in design manuals, but they have the RESPONSIBILITY to follow their own judgment. 

Then they spoke of the "Green Hierarchy" of road design where we prioritize for the most vulnerable vehicles. Brilliant.

Also, since most city streets are free--save for a few toll roads--trying to create a congestion free street is a fool's errand. Free things tend to be taken up, freely and road space is no exception.

Another good quote was we should start planning from the "outside in rather than inside out." This means that we should prioritize non-motorized vehicles then finally ask what space is left for automobiles rather than making a lot of travel lanes for cars then try to squeeze transit, pedestrians, and cycling on the fringes of roads and wonder why we don't have any space.

Another excellent quote is that "We you are successful at determining the mission, engineers are problem solvers."

We shouldn't say a problem can't be solved by engineers and give up. We should clearly define the problem then give it to engineers to chew on.

Overall, there were a lot of really inspiration and brilliant things that were said. Everything they said had resonance for me and was totally the opposite of advocates from San Diego were saying.

Thus, I feel that local advocates here are either totally ignorant of how the government, laws, and engineering work or they are completely lying about things.

There's far more hope for cycling in California than I had ever imagined.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Analysis of a Bad Case Study: Road safety and perceived risk of cycle facilities in Copenhagen</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[John--are they ALL named John? :)--recently pointed out a 
<a href="http://www.trafitec.dk/pub/Road%20safety%20and%20percieved%20risk%20of%20cycle%20tracks%20and%20lanes%20in%20Copenhagen.pdf">study.</a>

"If the figures for the road sections are combined with those for the junctions, an increase of 9-10% in accidents and injuries has taken place."

This is actually an effect I'd expect if someone started something new.

Before 1869, there were no motoring accidents. They increased as more people started driving.

Similarly, if more people bicycle, more people are going to get hurt.

Thus, it's idiotic to look at absolute increases in cycling accidents if we don't know the increase in mode share.

Fortunately, they finally give it which is 18-20% increase.

I don't have the absolute numbers, but if I increase a large number and increase a small number, the relative risk should go down.

But this study compares absolute risk only, and never gives relative risk.

Something is rotten in the State of Denmark.

I really smelled the fish, when they said that there was an 18% increase in female cycling accidents, but only a 1% increase in male cycling accidents. But there are all ready many more accidents for male cyclists than female ones. Thus in an absolute sense, there could actually be more males getting injured, but in a percent basis, this will look like less. Again with no raw data, one can't really say anything here.

Next the study admits that there is a large increase in safety for elderly cyclists and elderly motorists. Combining those two groups is bizarre, but there's one thing they have in common. Elederly and children take the least risks, and they are the most vulerable groups.

Thus, cycle tracks protect our most vulnerable groups. By how much? The study is silent on this, but it's a lot. Thus, we might say that we have slightly more accidents in teen girls, but not more in any other category.

We don't know how many more women ride, but from other studies, we know that women are the bell weather species of cyclists. That is, things are only good for cycling when women say so. I can think of a lot of other things that follow this rule. :)

The study didn't follow normal engineering standards, but rather it combined all injuries together which is stupid because I don't mind trading a fatality for a few skinned knees.

Also, the study is mind numbing in its detail in other areas that don't matter.

A 2000% increase is meaningless when there's a small risk of a minor problem.

Also, many of the problems the study pointed out are currently being mitigated or have been fixed which is why this type of study, when done well, can be very useful.

"It should be noticed that blue cycle crossings, retracted stop lines for cars and pre- green lights for cyclists have been used in only very few places on those streets where cycle tracks have been constructed in Copenhagen in the studied after periods. More extended use of these safety measures would very probably have improved road safety."

Great quote, but you will see uses of this study, out of context, ignoring the fact that in places like Copenhagen, safety through design is increasing daily, used against infrstructure.

"Taken in combination, the cycle tracks and lanes which have been constructed have had positive results as far as traffic volumes and feelings of security go. They have however, had negative effects on road safety."

Again, "safety" is a vague term. If there were more fatalities and serious injuries in a _relative_ sense then this would be true, but I don't have enough data to tell.

"Taken in combination, the cycle tracks and lanes which have been constructed have had positive results as far as traffic volumes and feelings of security go. They have however, had negative effects on road safety. The radical effects on traffic volumes resulting from the construction of cycle tracks will undoubtedly result in gains in health from increased physical activity. These gains are much, much greater than the losses in health resulting from a slight decline in road safety."

This is a nice conclusion which I'd like to agree with but what's a much, much greater health gain? How is that measured?

Overall, this was a terrible study with so much useless data and not enough good information.

However, it did suggest safety improvements so it wasn't a total wash.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for posting.

Note that when we have "safety facilities" NOT segregation, aka cycle tracks and the like, the actual sound goes down and we can actually have conversations with our riding partners.

Note, that I have NEVER heard a VC response to the SOUND factor in riding which is off putting for many of us including me.

Each time, I read a pro-VC rant, I hear intermittent LOUD noises interupting their line of reasoning which makes their arguments hard to follow. :)]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This is a bit of a convoluted study.  The author didn't simply compare collisions and injuries before and after the installation of cycle tracks and bike lanes, he compared the actual 'after' numbers to some hypothetical 'after' number that is supposed to represent what should have happened if the facility had never been built and that is based on a combination the actual 'before' numbers and overall improvements in traffic safety in the city of Copenhagen that happened since then, (which begs the question of what caused the overall safety improvements) and various conversion/multiplication factors.  In all cases, the hypothetical numbers were significantly lower than the actual 'before' numbers, so the reported increases or decreases in safety always look worse than they actually were.  There is no mention of this in the doc you linked to, you have to go to another doc to learn this.  http://www.vehicularcyclist.com/copenhagen2.pdf (can't find it anywhere else)    Also, the doc is a not so perfect English translation, maybe into British English, at times ambiguous and not clear.]]></wp:comment_content>

However, this study is used to "prove" that cycling infrastructure is dangerous.

  <title>Five Lies Your Quisling "Advocate" Told You</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/12/27/five-lies-your-quisling-advocate-told-you/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I am limiting myself to five because I'm a busy guy. I might address more later.

1. "People want infrastructure because it enhances safety."

I'm so sick of hearing this.

Yes, infrastructure is much safer than "taking the lane" on a cloverleaf interchange. We know this from data, from experience, and from common sense.

However, other reasons that are given for wanting infrastructure are totally ignored because Quislings know that if they address them, they will lose the argument.

Our desire for infrastructure is due to desire for comfort and for good manners.

Let's look at comfort. Nobody argues we should give up indoor plumbing and indoor heating. But I can teach a class on how you can live without it. I know a mental game you can play so it's AWESOME to live outdoors with the bears. But I don't do that because it's retarded to give up our material comforts.

Those of us who have enjoyed the material comfort of cycle tracks know that this is our opinion, only. It's like toppings for a pizza. There's no right answer.

You can probably figure out the healthiest toppings for a pizza, but I want anchovies. I'll take the nitrates and mercury, thank-you.

Also, due to manner because we feel that a single cyclist holding up traffic is bad manners. We all have differing views on manners and will never 100% agree. So again, this argument can not be defeated because it's a personal opinion.

My opinion happens to be held by the vast majority of motorists and cyclists.

So if someone brings up the nonsense above, kindly cut n' paste this argument ad nauseum. Then move on with your day.

This topic over and done, and I don't EVER want to hear this canard again.

2. "VC cycling is the ONLY safe way to ride a bicycle."

VC cycling is highly arrogant, stupid, and dangerous. I NEVER see anyone riding vesicularly in almost 15 years of cycling.

I am actually on the look-out for people riding like this in the wild. I'd like to take photos of it and hang it in a gallery like a zoo of strange human behavior.

3. "If you are for infrastructure or you oppose VC then you don't know how to ride a bicycle."

I have challenged many VC cyclists to come to San Diego and to show me how my commute would be AWESOME if I rode vehicularly.

Particularly, I'd like to sit down on Fairmount and have a picnic and let them show me now that we have a LOUD road with no alternatives, things are great.

Thanks to all those of you who fought against the bicycle by-pass that would have made my commute safer, more fun, and quieter.

The funny thing is that during this picnic, if you live to get there, I won't be able to hear all your brilliant arguments. This is because the road is too loud.

Loud noises and noxious smells are some of the few stimuli that humans will NEVER acclimate to. They will always be annoying. 

4. "Research shows that bike infrastructure is inherently unsafe. It can NEVER be made safe."

Really? I have never seen this research. I have seen research on the racist "segregated cycling" Wikipedia page which says the opposite of the quotation.

One of my New Year's goals is to join the page and set things right! :)

I don't have time to get into all the details, but the upshot is that there are no massive fatalities in places like Portland, Longbeach, NYC, Copenhagen, and many other cities which built infrastructure.

Thus, I'm not asserting that infrastructure need to be safe to be built (even though it is safe). I just feel that it must be shown to not be any more dangerous than what we have built all ready. Currently, our traffic safety on roads which follow the law, for cyclists who follow the law, is bad. That is a fact.

Finally, the whole notion that American engineers can not build bike lanes safely is insulting to engineers, cyclists, and Americans in general. They did it elsewhere, and they can do it here. Make safe, fun, and comfortable infrastructure.

5. "Cycling infrastructure is "illegal" because it's not in the vehicle code. Building infrastructure opens a city up to liability risk."

First of all, the vehicle code is a book of guidelines not some iron rule which we must all obey.

The actual law says that road design is in the engineer's discretion.

Further more, the vehicle code is constantly evolving. It wasn't given to us by Moses from on high.

Engineers like to innovate. This innovation has given us all the mechanical and electrical things that we enjoy. Allowing them to innovate on the roads have given us freeways and stop signs. We didn't always have any of these things.

In the future, we are going to look back and everything going to look barbaric and primitive. The only question is how FAST innovation goes.

There have been a few court cases where cities have been sued for liability for infrastructure that has killed people. They have been tossed out of court. Thus, there's a legal precedent protecting cycling infrastructure.

Finally, there has been at least one lawsuit by a family who's family member died because they did NOT build infrastructure.

So in terms of legal liability NOT building things is actually more risky than building things.

In summary, I'm sick of reading the same garbage ad nauseum. 

I know that this is mainly my fault for caring to read about cycling online at all. But overall, I do this out of love and as a public service to correct the lies that have been sputtering around the Internet since its inception.

Please stop.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Door Zone (and Other NYC Safety Data)</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/12/27/door-zone-and-other-nyc-safety-data/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[If you google for "door zone United States fatality statistics", there is little data which is itemized for this hazard.

Mostly,  you see things like this:

The Door Prize: Cyclists killed by dooring:

http://bicyclesafe.com/doorprize.html

You will notice that this has very few deaths, and many of them are dated.

Despite the paucity of deaths and the venerableness of the data, this is given as evidence that one should avoid the door zone.

I searched and searched for more data. Here's one piece:

http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=10&amp;ved=0CHMQFjAJ&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fnyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fdot%2Fdownloads%2Fpdf%2Fbicyclefatalities.pdf&amp;ei=74H6Ts7UN8b0sQKv5oC_AQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFFbYnqh05Qz1-6w5xTeryiiMxAMQ&amp;sig2=Hnyp5OCBrjwOnUu33RaEBw

Here are some juicy bits:

"Between 1996 and 2003, a total of 3,462 NYC bicyclists were seriously injured in crashes with motor vehicles."

"Between 1996 and 2005, 225 bicyclists died in crashes. Bicyclist deaths remained steady during the 10-year period."

Keep your eye on the latter number because there's much more.

"Nearly all bicyclist fatalities (92%) occurred as a result of crashes with motor vehicles."

"Only one fatal crash with a motor vehicle occurred when a bicyclist was in a marked bicycle lane."

Thus, 99.6% of all bicycle accidents occured OUTSIDE of a bike lane.

"A total of 7 fatal crashes occurred as a result of a bicyclist hitting a motor vehicle door or trying to avoid one. Four occurred in Manhattan and 3 in Brooklyn."

Thus, 96.8% of the people who died in NYC were NOT in the door zone.

I submit that a 3% chance of death is absurdly small, and there is no shame, and little danger in riding in the door zone.

I'll do more data analysis another day.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Cyclist Rights</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I'd like to take back the term "rights" regarding cycling.

Often, we hear that "if we build infrastructure" cyclists will lose their "rights to the road due to motorist's perceptions".

I do agree with rights to the road, but not in the same way.

Thus, there are rights and there are rights to the road.

Let's look at some concrete examples.

If some group has the right to go to college, but they fear that if they actually excercise this right, they will be killed.

Do they really have a right?

Many (callous) people would say "yes" because there's nothing inherently stopping the person from going.

I say, "no", we must do more to protect them especially when they are dying at two to three times the norm.

Similary, with 1% of mode share in the US, cyclists typically face 2% death rates which is small, but it's double that of the "norm".

Here are my ideas for rights to cycle:

1. Right to wear whatever I want without judgement. We don't anyone else's death into a fashion show. Thus, we need stop saying, "he wasn't wearing bright colors." Thus, my right to ride includes my right to wear black.

2. Right to be incompetent. In some places, cycling is a two minute class. Here it is apparantly a 15 hour lecture and hours of practice. I want the roads to be like an iPhone like they are in other places and not like a blinking dos prompt like they are now.

3. Right to be lazy. I want to be able to jump on my bike and get somewhere by navigating signs. I don't want to need a map, compass, and a secret decoder ring. I should be able to ask directions to a normal person without stopping them every 30 seconds with, "but it's illegal for me to get on the freeway." After this, literally, they stop helping me because they don't know how to get around otherwise.

4. Right not to be afraid. Ever. I should be taken care of.

5. Right to not be a mechanic. In other places, there are bike shops and bus stops everywhere. Here due to zoning, I have to literally walk for miles if I get a flat. This isn't right!

6. Right to converse. I need it to be quiet enough for me to hear my wife. Also, I need some protected lanes so we can ride side by side. All motorists have this right, why don't I?

Thus, while some see rights to the road as an abstract thing in motorist's and police officer's minds, I see it as a real, tangible reality.

For me, the "right to control the lane" is meaningless.

If one is going to fight for my "right to the road" they should consider that rights are not one thing, but they are many things.

Overall, the way to judge whether we have rights is to see if we have the same level of protection, comfort, and lack of thought that the govenrment currently gives to motorists.

Nobody but a daredevil wants empty rights.]]></content:encoded>

I agree whole heartily with your position.  I am not to concerned with the idea losing my rights when I already feel severely marginalized.  Maybe you could rework this into a cyclist version of the "I have a dream" speech.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I love the cartoon.

I was trying to expand "rights" to more than just the right to play in traffic.

Regarding the racial stuff mixed in with cycling activism, I'm attempting to work with others to explain how truly horrifically offensive the whole thing is.

We need cycling activism because we need more cyclist and we need cycling to be safer.

Conflating this with civil rights is very unnecessary and very, very wrong.

More will be explained on this later. I'm far from the expert on these issues...]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Questions for Orlando Data</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[http://www.metroplanorlando.com/files/view/bicyclist-crash-study.pdf

I have been trying to compare cycling fatalities across cities and states in the US and other countries.

I find that your data presentation is peculiar in that it's difficult to determine the safety of various activities.

For example, if you look at NYC data or NC data, you will find that the data is much easier to compare across state lines.

For example, I'd like to see, over 10 year period, how many people were doored.

Also, I see that you have broken out data for "cyclists violations" incsome categories, but you combine some illegal activities such ascsidewalk riding with legal activities such as riding in a bike lane.

Why did you do this? Perhaps you should break out bike lanes and sidewalk riding into separate categories.

Also, places like NYC separate out collisions with serious injuries.
In hazard analysis, serious injuries are much more important than those particular collisions which cause no injury. Can you please look  into this?

Anyway, I appreciate the good work you are doing in Orlando.

Thank-you for the data.

In my continued search to look at data, I have found some from Orlando, the most dangerous city in the US for cycling.

The data was very strange, but I did notice that 76%  of accidents were NOT on a sidewalk or bike lane. Despite this, the paper takes an anti-infrastructural approach.

Also, the door zone was my original goal, and I found that in this paper, ZERO, that's right ZERO fatalities from dooring.

Yet none of the analysis seemed to indicate that riding in the door zone was safe. This is in line with the tone of the paper which was to pin the blame of cycling accidents on cyclists, only, and to absolve the city and motorists, for the most part.

This is probably due to the "just world fallacy" where people try to convince themselves that they are different from victims and the victims did something wrong. This serves to protect one's ego from realizing how vulnerable they are.

Overall, the paper seemed to be written by someone who needed constant assurance that cycling was safe, and it spent most of the time assiging blame to cyclists instead of presenting the data in a way that was comparable to other cities.

I _am_ interested in what one can do to ride safer, but I found the notions that wearing neon made you safe to be laughable especially when there was ZERO data to back this belief up. Contrast this to other cities that sticks to data and analysis and leaves speculation to the uncycling thinkers. :)

Below is my letter.

  <title>Bicycle Advocacy Racism</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[To deal with a big problem, I called in some bigger guns. I sent an email to Smooth995, who makes great youtube videos:

[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Ti-gkJiXc]

&nbsp;

Below is the letter:

&nbsp;

I googled about this problem for a while, but I have failed to find an adequate way to explain this (really simple) concept.

Now, I could be wrong, but I think that appropriating the long hard battles for civil rights in order to use to defend a cycling racers right to race on public roads is offensive.

Am I off base?

To give you some background, there's a term in the community that I consider to be a loaded word which is "segregated facilities" (sic) which just means a bike lane:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segregated_cycle_facilities

Here's a really bad quote:

"Lastly, about Ollie's "pipe dread"... L.A. has tried the center of the road separated bike routing, other cities are trying to find ways to segregate bicycling from motor vehicle traffic. My take, separate ain't equal."

http://www.sandiegoreader.com/users/BikesAlot/comments/

So my questions for you are;

1. Is this racist? Or am I just overly sensitive?

2. If it _is_ racist, how do I explain this?

It's getting to the point that the term is more and more entrenched, and I'd like to nip this garbage before it's too late.

3. I so love your videos. I'd love to see one on this topic.]]></content:encoded>

This data set is much more similar to NYC than Orlando's data.

It has none of the Hindsight Man style of speculating how a cyclist could have avoided an accident had he been a cycling super hero. I say "he" because the vast majority of cyclist deaths are men. There are a lot of reasons for that, and I'd like to learn and emulate them all. :)

Also, it answers more questions I had regarding cycling style, risk, and the effect of infrastructure which Orlando tried to conceal by combining illegal sidewalk riding with legal bike lane riding.

My first question is always, the risk of the dreaded door zone.

I found this to be 0.2% of all fatalities which is similar to both NYC (044%) and Orlando (0%).

The biggest surprise in this meta-analysis is that NYC was not bigger. I'd expect areas with less of a grid, and less parallel parking to have much lower dooring rates, but it's all about the same in the biggest city to the more rural areas: negligible.

Next surprise, or not, the biggest fatal risk to a cyclist is for those who are "taking the lane".  In fact travel lane collisions made up 62% of all collisions while bike lanes and shoulders COMBINED only gave us 5% of collisions. Even the deadly sidewalk riders were a third less likely or rather 14% of all collisions were for sidewalk riders.

Thus to say "don't ride on the sidewalk, it's really dangerous" is not universally true. In fact, if someone starts acting as if they have some magic "skills" to make one safe, look into the data that they have to back this up and search for your own data as well.

It seems that bike lanes have saved many lives as cyclist were 12x more likely to die while riding "vehicularly" (sic) than in a bike lane or shoulder or any other way of getting out of the way of motor vehicles.

In summary of NC data, VC riding or taking the lane is more dangerous than riding on the bike lane, dedicated bike path, driveway, alley, and sidewalk, and non-roadway
COMBINED.

Also, the dreaded intersection accounted for 44% of all crashes while non-intersection were 49%. Thus to say that "the intersection is the most dangerous part of the road, the travel lane is safe" is wrong. It's slightly more common to have a collision when one is NOT in the intersection. If a cyclist is not on the road, this will elimate the vast majority of these collisions as other data has proven.

Hmm. I imagine I'll see a lot of Quislings who want to spin this data to blame the cyclist for not their religious dress code (neon) nor having flashing lights and otherwise making a spectacle of himself. Despite all this many of the deaths of NC cyclists were by those who were riding "legally" and "correctly".

From this data, I have found that taking the lane is dangerous. Riding on a bike path is safe even if it is the door zone.

I feel that "bicycle safety classes" ought to take off their very religious blinders and study the data a lot harder.

Looking for things that cyclists did obviously wrong is a good way to learn to ride safer. However, it is a shitty thing to use this information to bias urban design to be even more dangerous (aka more deadly VC roads) than it all ready is.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[First of all, I was mistaken about the combination of sidewalk riding and bike lane deaths. Actually bike lanes accounted for 5% of deaths while the travel lane was 40%.

Additionally, I  clarified dooring data because I was still astounded that nobody had been doored to death in Orlando in the period specified.

Here's the response from MetroPlan Orlando:

"Dooring is a relatively rare event in metro Orlando, as there are relatively few commercial arterials and collectors with parallel, on-street parking.  Most of our area developed during the 70s, 80s and 90s when on-street parking was not considered to be a normal (let alone desirable) street function.  I can only think of three doorings (that I've been made aware of) in my 27 years here.  One in which I witnessed the aftermath (cyclist on the pavement, with fortunately minor injuries).  Another reported to me by the victim (who did not report it to the police) that took place in a door-zone bike lane (also minor injuries).  The third involved a passenger-side door opening into that same door-zone bike lane (which was reported to the police)."]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Effectiveness and Selection of Treatments for Cyclists at Signalised Intersections</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I found a GREAT paper on this topic (of the same name).

https://www.onlinepublications.austroads.com.au/items/AP-R380-11

Clearly, we need much, much more data on this topic before we can say anything definitive. However, this is an excellent start.

In fact this paper is so loaded with gems, it does set off my "confirmation bias" alarms which never allow me to enjoy anything too much. :)

Thus, if any of the big John-Johns (you know who you are you old legends) or the various Jims or Bobs of the world want to shred this paper using their superior microscope skills, be my guest.

I haven't really clarified the rules of commenting, but one of them states that you only get ONE comment to get things right. I won't go back and forth with people. Also, this should stop the silly ad hoc argument style that is so common in the "community".

I'm going to put down some gems from the paper, but you should really read the original.

Note, all quotes have some from the above paper unless listed otherwise.

I. UNDER REPORTING:

This is the first paper which has addressed this issue. The rate of under reporting ranged from 71-78%,

With less than a 10% range, this data was pretty tight. I'd like to see some data from the United States. This is obviously hard to do. However, we could set up a toll free number for anonymous reporting of collisions. Better yet would be an online form.

II. INTERSECTION COLLISIONS:

Ah, intersections. These are the anti-facilities proponent's dream as they LOVE to repeat the old saw on how facilities greatly increase the number of collisions at intersections.

"At intersections, Hunter et al. reported that 93 percent of the intersection conflicts were coded as minor, and THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES BY FACILITY TYPE." [Emphasis mine and all mine.]

But what about the extra wide lane? These are used primarily by anti-infrastructure proponents due to the fact that they do give cyclists extra passing space but do not break the illision that a bicycle is exactly the same as a motor vehicle:

"Motor vehicle actions more associated with wide kerbside lane conflicts included turning right (left in the Australian/ New Zealand context) in front of a cyclist after passing, and “other” actions such as failing to give way, improperly turning right and not allowing cyclists enough room."

Hmm, I thought that separation of cycles and cars, only, caused this problem.

"The addition of an advanced limit line for cyclists is expected to result in a 27% reduction in cyclist crashes..."

So a small change in infrastructure can greatly reduce crashes. Who knew?

"A before and after study by Herrstedt et al. (1994) carried out a study on the layout of cycle lanes, on the approaches to intersections. Following the construction of the cycle lanes, cycle crashes
declined by 35% at intersections."

Again, I thought that bike lanes increases intersection collisions...

What else can be done to make intersections safer?

"An OECD report (1998) reported that the Danish Road Administration (1994a) had carried out a study at four signalised intersections, where the stop lines for motorists were recessed by five
metres...Prior to implementation, between 12% and 24% of drivers turned right straight in front of a cyclist. After implementation only 3% to 6% did."

Fascinating. So infrastructure, all by itself, can actually educate motorists!

"Elvik and Vaa (2004) found that adding cycle lanes through a signalised intersection reduce cycle crashes by 12% but increases overall crashes by 14%."

III. SEPARATED INFRASTRUCTURE (BIKE LANES AND FRIENDS):

"The construction of cycle lanes was demonstrated in the before and after study to reduce cycle crash rates by 10%."

Enough said. I'm just going to not so silently gloat on this one.

CYCLE LANES...REDUCED CYCLE CRASHES. Haha.

"In New Zealand, most on-roadway cycle crashes occur in locations not specifically allocated for cycling; only 7% of crashes occurred in a cycle lane, Munster (2001). Marked cycle lanes also have been shown in the US to result in fewer cyclist/pedestrian conflicts..."

This number is consistent from other studies which show that less than 10% of collisions are in designated, separated cycling lanes.

I'm actually super-interested where this number is greater than 10% because I like to challenge my own assumptions. If someone can show me a place where the majority of collisions are in cycle lanes please let me know. I'd also like to see places where a cycle lane is put in and rear-ending INCREASES. I never saw this in actual data.

However, I see people claim this is true ALL THE TIME. Please show the data.

In fact, the impetus for much of this research is to explore the above claim. I really did not think that it was so easy to refute which is why I put this off as long as I did. This raises the question on whether someone is either ignorant or out right lying... :)

Here's the closest thing I could find (from above study):

"Jensen (2007) built upon his previous research, again conducting a before and after survey to investigate the safety benefits of where cycle tracks and cycle lanes has been implemented in
Copenhagen, Denmark. The key results from the research showed that there is a 10% increase in cycle crashes as a result of bicycle tracks (behind kerb) in urban areas."

Note that Jensen is the only Dane, related to cycling, that VCers ever loved. That's OK,  because I love Jensen as well. I really appreciate this level of detail in cycle infrastructure research.

"...Turner et al (2009) identified that off road cycle paths have higher crash risks particularly at points where they intersect with the local road network."

I love this quote because this shows that while much care has been given to dedicated cycling infrastructure regarding separation of travel lanes, more work needs to be done for intersections. Since engineers tend to be creative problem solvers, I'm psyched to see what they come up with next terms of cycling safety for intersection design.

This is probably the best quote from the entire article:

"The results initially seemed to indicate that the overall effect of adding cycle lanes in Christchurch and Adelaide were quite different. The addition of cyclist facilities in Christchurch resulted in a 20% reduction in the total number of crashes. However, in the case of Adelaide, a 37% increase in the total number of cycle crashes was observed after installation of cycle facilities. However, closer analysis shows that the differences are largely due to the unusual characteristics of the “other” crash group in each city, which is described below. When other crashes are excluded the
implementation of cycle lanes made little difference to the overall crash numbers. However to the extent that implementation of those facilities increased cycling along those routes, the risk per
cyclist has reduced."

This is really key because some advocates like the cherry pick data. The point is that infrastructure when done badly can make things worse. This should be written in the sky or something. We need to realize this.

How to make infrastructure better? I don't know. Did we make air travel safer by banning air travel?

We really need to do many, many more experiments. Overall, this will lead to a saving of lives. Like the introduction of fire, electricity, and running water, this might result in higher deaths if we take isolated instances out of context. Overall, like other technological progress, cycling will get better and better the more we give engineers the freedom to work on it.

IV. EDUCATION

"OECD (1998) found that children under the age of 10 and the elderly do not have the ability to cope in traffic situations."

This has been tested and found to be true. Even when tested with the unparalleled "expert" of cycling education, young children were at significant risk when riding in the high speed through streets which are present all over San Diego.

"The prime objective was to determine whether children of grades 3 and 5 could learn useful levels of traffic cycling skills in a reasonable time...This cycling on residential streets is probably about as difficult a task as children of this age (8 years) can handle without a lot more experience...Furthermore, all these children appeared confused when confronted with situations in which they ought to consider traffic from several directions simultaneously, as at busy 2-lane 4-way stops. Admittedly, we had given them no training in this situation, but to reach that instructional level would require a lot more instructional time. This age and grade level appears to encompass the appropriate developmental stage at which children can first learn the basics of traffic cycling (at least with present teaching techniques and in today's very cycling-ignorant society) but are not yet ready for more complicated situations."

http://www.johnforester.com/Articles/Education/elecpro.htm

Contrast this with Denmark where you see many, many young children peddling around with grandma on cycle-tracks. Hopefully, with Safe Routes to School and other programs, we will soon build the infrastructure to overcome the limitations that younger children have in dealing with the complicated road situations in San Diego, which stump even adults.

Hopefully, we can get cycle training in this region down to two minutes instead of the 15 plus hours (TWO DAYS OF CLASS) that the resident "experts" recommend.

Despite the education vs. engineering debate, there is not an either or when it comes to infrastructure. That is, infrastructure itself can actually educate motorists. Thus every dollar in infrastructure is a dollar spend making cyclists safer AND educating ALL cyclists and ALL motorists. Infrastructure is inexpensive to maintain and they cycling culture that it will promote is robust, lasting longer than the lives of the original proponents.

A dollar spend on education will educate one out of millions of people. Once that person dies, that money is gone forever. Finally, road conditions are evolving, and eduction needs to be lifelong. The mere act of riding a bicycle itself in decent infrastructure provides this life long school for cyclists.

V. MISC. CHANGES

Here are some items I could not find a category for:

"Traffic management strategies like traffic calming have been shown to reduce cyclist crashes by 36%..."

"The crash prediction models show a pronounced safety in numbers effect, i.e. the crash risk per cyclist reduced at higher cycle volumes."

This has been talked about a lot. All data, so far, shows this to be true. Thus, even if infrastructure is neutral in its "true" safety, if it gets more people on bikes, it will increase overall safety for both motorists and cyclists.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

Like all real world data, the data here is a bit muddy. That's OK. In fact, having too clear data is a clue that some kind of fraud is being committed.

"The overall effect of cycle lanes was neutral. Cycle lanes built to high standards improve cyclist safety. Those built to lesser standard can reduce cyclist safety."

In cases where it seems to increase collisions, this is often a local effect that is mitigated by intersection treatments, safety in numbers, and other means.

Thus, I will conclude that infrastructure really saves lives.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey! Regular readers, no need to read this. You are intelligent enough to know all of what I'm going to say.

This post is aimed at the stupid people who whine about me, and others about our "failure to cite data."

In debates with people (VC/Quislings, I'm looking at you) continue to claim that I (and my friends) fail to cite data.

That's really, really funny. Here's why.

There's this invention called the internet that doesn't have everything, but it does have a lot of really, really good data including the most up to date scholarly papers, many of which are available for FREE!

Wait! There's more.

There's this other awesome invention called google.com. This is a URL, uniform resource locator. You type it into that bar thingie at the top of the program known as a "web browser" such as IE (for those still reading) or chrome, opera, lynx, or firefox (for those who have rolled their eyes and stopped reading long ago.)

Here's the skinny. You go to google.com and type in your question. You will get THOUSANDS of hits.

Most lazy people, like me, will only read the first few.

Read 'em!

???

Now profit! :)

There's your data!

You'll notice that many of my pronouncements that I make match up with the data found on google!

Isn't that nuts?

Sometimes we don't agree. That's because real world experiments are messy. Things differ,in cycling, from place to place and time to time. (Which is, incidentally, why you need to update your cycling safety classes). :)

Oh, and that other stuff which can not be proven by experiments? That, my friend, is called an opinion. Again, yours and mine may differ.

That's OK. But since it's my blog; it's my house. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Buffered Bike Lane</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/01/13/buffered-bike-lane/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I am writing this to answer many of the objections to buffered bike lanes.

Most of these objections are going to seem silly and stupid. That's because they are both.

These objections are not real objections based upon a person trying to make the world a better place, but rather they are only being asked as a last ditch attempt to toss up smoke to prevent infrastructure.

I spoke of this before, this is due to the religious belief that cycling infrastructure is inherently bad.

Since this is an absurd view, to be more politically savvy, the questions are raised as concerns in the usual soft and dishonest manner we have seen before.

Q: What is it?

A: It's a bike lane with an additional buffer for safety. This buffer is generally a hash mark or a chevron.

Q: Won't this make intersections more dangerous? Won't motorists be confused?

A: No it won't.

http://bikeportland.org/2011/05/12/pbot-data-buffered-bike-lanes-lead-to-big-safety-benefits-on-holgate-52885

While it's difficult to find crash data on buffered bike lanes only, they tend not significantly increase injuries. If they did kill a lot of people or confused motorists to the point where there was a problem, they would have been removed.

Q: Won't this make traffic flow faster as cyclists slow down traffic?

A: In most cases small changes like this do not cause a change in traffic volume or number of cars that get through a given area. They do reduce motorists speeds, however. This makes things safer for pedestrians, motorists, and cyclists.

In fact, most buffered bike lanes are not put into place for cyclists, but due to their secondary traffic calming which benefits the entire community and takes nothing away from the motorists.

Q: Won't this take up valuable parking space which will hurt local business?

A: No. There has never been a business became bankrupt because public parking spaces were removed. A business that depends on their usage, for free, of public resources like parking are always going to be vulnerable to changes in the political climate.

However, businesses in bike friendly areas tend to do as well if not better than businesses with more dead space wasted on storage of private vehicles on public land.

Q: Won't this take away my "right to take the lane"?

I honestly don't know.

Most people do not want to ride in traffic because they, correctly, see the danger in it.

There is no legal "right for cyclists to ride on all roads" as they are banned from the freeways.

The main reasons one would want to ride in the road is because:

1. There's not alternative.

With a buffered bike lane this is no longer valid.

2. It's seen as "safe".

With a buffered bike lane this is no longer valid.

3. It's faster.

This may be so, but if we let motorists speed they'd go faster, too. This is obviously not allowed for safety reasons.

4. It's a "right".

A right to do something that is annoying, dangerous, selfish, and stupid actually is not a right.

On the other hand, everyone has the right to a choice of a safe, efficient, and comfortable transporation mode and a buffered bike lane facilitates this.

Q: Buffered bike lanes are experimental. It's foolish to advocate for something that we have not seen.

A: Promoting the benefits of something based upon engineer's expert opinions is not foolish. Ignoring the data for success in other places is foolish.

Furthermore, there have been several bike lanes with buffers next to them, and there were no problems with them at all. I don't think that anyone died in any of them. On the other hand, there are many roads where people do die, and there's little outcry from the same camp to better engineer these roads.

Q: Is the city open to liability if they build a buffered bike lane?

A: I don't know; as a non-lawyer, I don't give legal advice.

But there's no reason to suspect that their liability would be magically higher for this. In fact, the law states that the final decision on design is made by the designer, the engineer.

At any rate, the city has lawyers who will make sure that liability is not a problem.

Q:Will a buffered bike lane be too expensive?

A: No it won't. This is the least expensive way to get people cycling. With all the benefits it offers regarding more cyclists, safety, better health, quieter streets and more, the buffered bike lane will pay for itself.

Q: Because a cyclist is a vehicle, won't a cyclist be imprisoned behind a buffered bike lane, unable to move, for ever due to the fact that vehicles can't cross double lines?

A: No. This is a long, long discussion as there are many parts of the law to consider.

However, on the buffered bike lane on Park Ave just below University St, in San Diego, there was never a question of cyclists being trapped. They rode to where they needed to. Also, motorists were also able to navigate perfectly well. There were no tickets wrongly issued either.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Door Zone Face Off!!</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Below is an interesting discussion I had with John. We went back and forth for a while.

Originally, I was upset about his door zone webpage.

I do agree that bike lanes should not be in door zones even though it's "within code" in the highway manual. This is why the highway code is not always the best place for bikway design, and we need to use things that work elsewhere.

Initially, I thought that the door zone page had useful info, but then I realized that like other door zone pages, it was merely a thinly disguised anti-bike lane page.

I looked at the data and presented it to Mr. John. He got angrier and angrier.

At first, he repeated stale notions like the idea that most rear end collisions occur in rural areas, which is not true as most bike collisions are urban and many of the studies do not even list rural collisions.

The results are very consistent in showing how there are some major injuries and a few deaths in the door zone there are worse kinds of injuries.

The more data I gave, the more personal John got. I noticed that this was a pattern.

If the data is bad then we get personal. Then we argue from authority.

Yes, I love being insulted in arguments because it makes me feel as if I'm getting somewhere. :)

But then again, I'm not a bik exprt (sic), but I do know how to spell expert. :)

Below is the transcript:

We both want to make riding safer by better informing cyclists.

I have no interest in angering you, and no interest in debating you.

We are too intelligent, and reasonable people with the same information in front of us.

I feel that you should tell cyclists ALL the information that they need to make a smart decision.

I was merely asking for more data because I thought that your webpage was misleading by telling cyclists to ride in places where they are more likely to die.

I avoid the door zone as much as possible, but I also like to stay out of the travel lane especially when cars are moving faster than 30 MPH because we both know that's the speed where collisions become deadly and that's the speed where overtaking by motorists is more necessary.

In San Diego, most roads are very fast. Fortunately, more of them are getting bike lanes which force motorists to pass with greater
distance. Bike lanes also allow me to ride further away from the door zone.

Can you please just look at the data in a new way rather thanimmediately trying to make up some kind of excuse on why this is unimportant.

I can show you places where you distort the data.

I looked at your quote:

&gt;&gt;http://www.bikexprt.com/massfacil/cambridge/doorzone/laird1.htm

"Ms. Laird could have understood that the relative risk of riding in the "door zone" from "dooring" collisions and other crashes is many times higher than the risk of being struck by overtaking vehicles when riding outside the "door zone." She might then have ridden at the very left edge of the marked bike lane, or outside the lane. "

I found dooring to be 0.44% in New York and Orlando, 0%, both of which are not rural. NYC is WELL LIT as well.

Toronto has a 0.4% of deaths in 2003 from dooring while there are 4x as many deaths from being rear ended.

Also, there are no more COLLISIONS in Toronto from dooring than being rear ended.

In every study, I listed below there are at least 4x more overtaking deaths than door zone deaths including the original Cross study.

In his study, dooring was a mere 0.6% fatal vs. 24% by being rear ended.

Even with the statistical games that John Forester plays, which discounts situations where I find myself all the time, it's 5% of
deaths are by rear ending which is 8x as high for being rear ended.

I'm just saying that whenever you give risk of the door zone, you need to give fatalities as well as the number of fatalities in other areas such as the travel lane. Otherwise, the data is misleading.

&gt;And that some places are different from others -- but on the other hand, most streets with parallel parking do not have high speed &gt;limits.

Which would suggest that they are safer.

However, I ride on a road, daily, where there is parallel parking and people ride &gt; 50 MPH. Should I take the lane and increase my risk of death by 4x?

&gt; The fact that something is illegal doesn't keep it from happening, now does it? Doesn't keep either of these kinds of crashes from happening.

Nor does it prevent the 4x (or much more) chance of being rear ended.

&gt;&gt; No, actually, rear-ending often happens to cyclists riding at night without lights.

So rear ending never happens during the day?

Actually, during the day, collisions with motor vehicles, in urban areas, is still more deadly than being hit by a door.

&gt;Diving into a pool where you can't tell if it's deep enough is legal too.

Why are you talking of swimming pools.

John, you are intelligent person. Please stay on topic.

&gt; Yes, getting rear-ended on rural roads is a major cause of fatalities. It is  not the major cause of fatalities in urban areas. Read this:

Getting rear ended during the day, indeed, is more common for  fatalities in urban areas than being doored.

Even the crusty Cross study from the 1970's show rearending is 3x higher than other one.

&gt; That's because the Cross study only accounts for how many crashes occurred.  It makes no account of whether there are parked

&gt; cars. Studies in urban areas show several times the rate of doorings. Then there are all the other types of crashes that happen by

&gt;riding too close to parked cars. You didn't read my examination.
No, the Toronto study that you linked to showed no more rear ending COLLISIONS than doorings.

Still, I argue that using  collision data is misleading. This is a common tactic used to distort data and to make things look more dangerous than it is. For example, when a study shows that cycle tracks have more collisions this is said to show that they are unsafe even when they save lives.

This data is not put under the same microscope that other data is put under, but merely accepted due to confirmation bias.

When people talk about risk, they want to know if they will die or be seriously injured. Why do you use the word "risk" in a non-standard way?

&gt; Again, because he made no study of whether the streets had parallel parking or not, greatly diluting the results. Read my material &gt; bout Santa Barbara, Gainesville, Austin, Boston, Toronto.

I'm arguing that you are misleading people and you should include travel lane deaths from the papers you show as well as more recent evidence from urban areas such as New York. I did much of this work for you by giving you three new papers.

You did not read the papers, but merely referred me to your biased view of doorings based on misreadings of papers.

I am trying to correct you on this. I have no idea why you are wasting time arguing rather than looking at the data.
I'd like you to put this up on your site.

Don't say that it happened on rural roads at night.

&gt;Now you're getting me angry. Don't you tell me what to say, thank you very much. I have a right to my opinions, and you don't

&gt; have a right to order me around.

But this is a matter of data and not opinion, right?

We have to go with the data no matter whether we like it or not.

Or are you suggesting that riding style is a "matter of opinion"?

I did and I was told there was "scientific evidence" of a riding style. I looked at the evidence, and it was the opposite of what was claimed. I'm seeing a pattern here.

2. Rural roads are not rural, this means that the cyclists has no bike
lane nor shoulder. By riding vehicularly, you are converting an urban
road into a rural one.

&gt; Rural roads are not rural? Yeah, and the Pope isn't Catholic.

You are familiar with Cross's definition of rural roads which are high  speed and with no shoulder, right?

To say "rural" road like you did is misleading because you don't clarify that many of these roads are in cities. I ride on one
everyday.


&gt; You are becoming a troll now.

Why are you becoming angry when I am giving you good information?

What do you mean by troll, a well informed person?

&gt; There is no "only reason" for any type of crash. The major reason is that traffic is slow. People are compelled to
&gt; ride in the line by many things, even if they don't want to.

This is true, but you seem to imply that merely riding in the door zone, a single cause, creates accidents. This is untrue. Other causes MOST door zone deaths are one motorist acting unlawfully and high speed traffic. Cyclists can not control for these things.

Riding in the lane to "prevent a door zone accident" opens a cyclist up to other dangers which is why better infrastructure is needed.

I am working to eliminate these kinds of risks as well as the notion that people have to wear stupid, bright colors and to have big
flashing lights. There are people who are rear ended here, in San Diego, and they have all the lights.

&gt; You have cited a lot of numbers without saying where they are from or what  the amount of mileage was on any of these, or what &gt; kind of streets.

I gave you links to all my data.

&gt; Nonsense to make this comparison because there are many kinds of crashes
&gt; between intersections, and not only the overtaking crash. And because 75% or
&gt; more of bicycle crashes don't involve a car at all.

Most deaths do.

The link you gave me above was talking about how to prevent DEATH.

This is another statistical trick. To compare door zone collision rate with the death rate for rear ending which is divided by some arbitrarily large number like total cyclist collisions.

We must compare apples to apples and door zone deaths are so low in many areas to be non-existant. Why make such a scary page about something that doesn't even exist in some places?

I smell a hidden agenda.

My argument is that riding vehicularly will increase risk of death or serious injury.

I posted tons of evidence to support this.

I am starting to feel that you are attached to certain ideas and everything is getting distorted around it.

In fact, being rear ended is the most deadly of all collisions in every study I have seen including the ones you presented.

&gt; But it is very rare.

If by rare, you mean to say that "while rare, there are 4x as many travel lane deaths as door zone deaths."

Another way to say it is that travel lane deaths are rare, but door zone deaths are 4x as rare.

In fact, door zone deaths are so rare as to not even worry about. I don't even worry about riding in the door zone for this reason.

I agree that cycling is relatively safe, though several times more dangerous than driving a car and to many more complicated.

Since it is so safe, the travel lane is mostly safe, the door zone is much safer, why are we concerned about the door zone at all?

Why not make a page urging for better infrastructure so more people can ride?]]></content:encoded>

  <title>What is an Expert?</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/01/14/what-is-an-expert/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Often in the cycling world, we have the testimony of "experts."

Overall, this sounds like a good idea

We need to have people who really know what they are talking about before we make decisions on riding style and infrastructure.

Right?

I'd argue that, "no", we don't need an expert at all. What we need is good data to decide what's best practice.

But won't an expert give us the best data?

I'm not sure. Maybe. I'm not against educated people looking objectively at data. However, I am a little suspicious when I can clearly see things being true, in professional data, and I am told the opposite is true, and that I'm too stupid to even read some simple statistics.

If we are to decide whether we need experts or not, we should first decide what makes an expert cyclist advocate?

Let's first look at what does NOT make an expert.

An expert is not someone who is merely old. It is ageist (sic) to say that a younger person needs to "respect his elders" with regard to the facts.

In fact, the facts are open to all of us to look at and are not the monopoly of a single generation especially ones that keep telling us how awesome they are. (I'm looking at you, Greatest).

An expert is not someone who repeats himself--yes, himself, there are few older women who try to lord their non-existant expertise over others--over and over again.

So what is an expert?

I have worked for a number of them over the years, and in general, but not always, are bad speakers. But not all bad speakers are real experts, of course.

Experts give data to back up their claims. If they don't have data, they will say "I don't know". Experts are well read in their topic, and they are constantly learning new data.

Experts don't assume that the past will be like the future, but they are constantly looking for new findings.

Experts are generally unsure of themselves and will lose a public "debate" with someone who knows nothing on the topic, but is able to give a false sense of confidence.

Experts are humble and are more interested in learning the right thing rather than being right in a moment.

Experts often change their minds and are not afraid to admit it.

The more the expert knows about a topic, the less dogmatic and less certain they will be on anything because they will realize that there are always exceptions. Still, an expert will not get distracted by exceptions, but rather will be able to give the facts which are relevant in most cases.

When an expert evaluates something, such as a road for safety, they will be able to give, ahead of time, the criteria that they are looking for. Experts can train other experts and are happy to do so. But an expert will urge others to go and read on their own as well.

One of the biggest problems that experts have is confirmation bias (read _You Are Not So Smart, book). This infects everything we learn because we have said things in the past, and we like to seem smart. Thus, when contradictory data comes along, we'll mentally fight it.

The way around this is the corny, but true saying, "Zen mind, beginners's mind" which means we try to keep everything fresh by forgetting what we know to learn more. Another way of putting this is "empty your cup" which means that we need to have an open mind when learning, always.

Thus, if someone is truly an expert, you will know that they are right through the clear presentation of data rather than the insistence that you are too stupid to understand anything and thus should take their word for it.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>The Safety Delusion </title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/01/17/the-safety-delusion/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The other day, someone at worked as me if I were afraid to die on the streets.

This told me a number of things. 

One was that in his mind, and many others, a bicycle equals death.

I wrote about this before.

Another thing, though, was that it implied that motoring was safe.

Not a safer choice, given conditions, but just plain old safe.

It's not.

I wondered where he got this idea since there are so many car accidents, we all know at least one person who has been injured in one, and many more of us were in them.

I don't know the answer to this question, but it affects how we treat road design.

This is why I oppose our hysteria about drunk driving and our hand waving over motorist education about our "rights to the road."

Yes, we should not drink and drive. Yes, we should be educated.

But I'd argue that poorly designed roads are as much to blame for people's deaths as drunks and lack of education.

When we focus on drunks and learning, we seem to pretend that the roads are safe right now. We just need smarter, sober drivers.

I have been looking into other alternatives.

One of them is "Sustainable Safety."

http://www.swov.nl/uk/research/kennisbank/inhoud/05_duurzaam/sustainablesafety.htm

This movement started in 1991, and it seeks to continually make countries like the Netherlands, safer.

"At the same time, every year, we have to regret the fact that so many road traffic casualties occur. This represents enormous societal loss."

This is from the safest country in the world.

They are so humble.

The difference here is that there is an emphasis on safety in engineering. 

It is assumed that the same is true in the United Statses, but from my limited contact with people, there is no.

In vehicle purchasing there is a desire for the appearance of safety, but many vehicles that are bought for safety purposes, like SUVS, are actually less safe than cars.

But when people have complained to the City of San Diego because they felt a section was unsafe, the city disagreed. This is despite several accidents happening there.

So the burden of proof is on us. Roads designed within code are seen as safe. This is despite our large number of traffic deaths a year.

On the other hand, things that have worked well in other countries, saving many lives, Countries like the Netherlands have had a twenty-fold reductions in children deaths after the "Stop de Kindermoord" (Child Murder Campaign).

I wonder why we have not had the same outrage to the deaths of children in the US.

This blog post talks more about Sustainable Safety:

http://hembrow.blogspot.com/2010/01/sustainable-safety.html

Strangely, in California where there are more cycling deaths, in proportion to the number of riders, yet less money spent on safety for cyclists, new innovations are put under a microscope because they may be "unsafe".

The reality is that that roads are all ready unsafe, and the fact that people don't ride means that we don't care about cyclists here.

As pointed out elsewhere, if they merely made cycling illegal, more people would be doing it. Right now it's seen as so terrible, dangerous, and unpleasant, more people smoke pot, which is illegal than ride a bicycle.

Why is this? I don't really know the answers, but I do realize that this reality means that we have been sold out by Quislings who have made cycling worse than illegal.

For those who'd like to see what real advocates have done, let's look at a movie about them in the Netherlands:

  <title>Burning Kens on My Lawn</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Before we get off on the wrong foot, let's just say that I am a BIG fan of Kenneth Cross and his research.

My goal is to burn down the house of cards which is based upon a misreading of his research, but I have nothing but good to say about the man (and all other men [and women]).

For some people, it's always 1977 and the Ramones are getting a "Teenage Lobotomy".

And so it goes as I venture into the well trod and tired world of <a href="http://ntl.bts.gov/lib/25000/25400/25439/DOT-HS-803-315.pdf">Kenneth Cross's 1977 study.</a>

Why do I waste time on a study which is over 30 old?

Mainly because it's the basis of _Effective Cycling_ a book everyone should read especially when they find themselves as hostages in Iran.
 
My goal is bury this study once and for all.

I want a VCer to be highly embarrassed when I mention Dr. Cross and his study because they have been exposed as humbugs as surely as the man behind the black curtain.

But I didn't come to bury Dr. Cross, but to praise him.

From the good man himself:

"I am pleased by the increasing rationality among those concerned with bicycle programs. There is less emotionalism and more informed discussion at bicycle conferences.Definitive data are beginning to appear from bicycle research. Funding agencies at the national level have become aware of bicycle safety and the social benefits of bicycling. All of these changes point to a promising future for bicycling in the United States.”— Ken Cross, 1978"

Yes, he's actually quite an affable fellow, and his study is a landmark in cycling research, but it does have some short comings which are no fault of Dr. Cross.

First of all, the study is old, and things have changed. Cycling technology has gotten a lot better. Many of the ideas, like good cycling lights, have been invented. Automotive radar is, perhaps, around the corner.

Ironically, his study has been used, in the US, to squelch more research in safe infrastructure and we are many years behind. This is not Cross' fault.

In fact, my goal is to resurrect his original message to move research forward or at least to shut up the local nutjobs who quote his study in vain.

First, let's see the quote that launched a thousand anti-bike way ships:

"Crucial to this policy is the superstition that the greatest danger to cyclists is same-direction motor traffic. Experienced cyclists such as myself knew that the major collision hazards came from conditions ahead of the cyclist, just as they do for motorists, but we had no scientific data on this point. California contracted with Ken Cross to make a statistical study of car-bike collisions, in the expectation that this study would demonstrate the truth of the superstition that the greatest hazard to cyclists came from same-direction motor traffic. Ken's study was presented to the California Statewide Bicycle Committee at a meeting room in the Sacramento Airport. After the presentation, I rather naively pointed out that the Cross study supported all that I had been saying and utterly disproved the supposed basis for California's policy."

http://www.johnforester.com/Articles/Safety/Cross01.htm

Note how he says that people's fears of being rear ended are "superstitious" this is really important because we are going to come back to it.

There's a funny thing about superstition and that is that we all have biases. Even me. Heck, especially me; I have breakfast with my biases daily. I want to be intimately acquainted with their biases.

Sometimes, though, we can read a paper, and make an honest mistake.

This is what I think happened when the book _Effective Cycling_ was written.

Here's the first one (with page number from the study for easy reference):

Page 256

"The fear of overtaking accidents is well founded since the likelihood of fatal injuries is indeed higher for overtaking accidents than for any other class of accidents revealed by this study."

Remember how above, we were told that this fear was "superstitious" and yet here in Cross's study, the basis of all VC, this was the opposite.

Some of the things that VC people say are true, but many, many of their quotes turn out to be totally false. In fact, every time there's a quote, I do a five minute google search and often, I can find that their quotes are not substantiated by the data at all.

Recall the anti-infrastructure bent the VC community has visited upon us?

Page 267

"Except for accidents that resulted from the motor vehicle being out of control, it seems reasonable to assume that most Class D accidents would not have occurred if an on-street bicycle lane had been present and the bicyclist had been riding in it."

So Cross sees the benefit of infrastructure. Guess what? Like many cases, here he's right.

There's more:

"There is virtually no doubt that off-street bicycle lanes would reduce the incidence of overtaking accidents, if such facilities were available and used by bicyclists who otherwise would be riding on roadways."

But what about education? Doesn't that help?

"With only a few exceptions, there is little that a
bicyclist can be taught that would help him avoid Class D accidents once he has decided to ride where and when such accidents are most likely to occur.

As a consequence, the primary objective of an education and training program for bicyclists should center on modifying the bicyclist's choice of where and when he will ride."

Note, that he doesn't promise that there's a magic riding style to "liberate us all from superstition." This was nonsense that was made up and put into Cross's mouth.

Basically, Cross is saying that some roads are too dangerous to ride on at all.

Check this out:

http://cyclingsavvy.org/hows-my-driving/

"Many bike lanes are designed poorly or just plain dangerous. Bike lanes next to parked cars are often entirely within a hazard area we call “the door zone.” A suddenly-opened door can kill a cyclist."

This is funny because in an earlier blog post, I talked about how dooring wasn't a problem in Florida. It's just too small of a problem to be worried about. Haha, superstition.

"Driving in the middle of the lane actually protects cyclists against the most common motorist-caused crashes: sideswipes, right hooks, left crosses, and drive-outs.  A bicycle driver’s top safety priority is to ensure he or she can be seen by motorists with whom they might potentially be in conflict, and bicycling in the middle of a lane is one of the most effective ways to do that.  Most overtaking crashes involve a motorist who attempts to squeeze past (illegally) in a lane that is too narrow to share."

Actually, as you suspect, this is a lie.

If you look on problem 16 on page 237, you'll see just 1.8% fatalities for a motorist trying to squeeze past. The 4% of the problem 14 where there's no possible evasive action is greater, and there are other risks which are greater as well.

So you wonder, where they got this information from and why they don't post data for us to look at it?

In fact, with such wrong data, I suspect that they merely made shit up.

From page 227:

"Many bicycling experts advocate riding in the center of the traffic lane rather than along the right-hand edge of the roadway. They claim that riding in the center of the traffic lane increases the chances of
being observed by motorists who are preparing to enter the roadway from intersecting streets or driveways.

"Also, they argue that riding in the center of the lane provides a greater buffer zone between the bicycle's path and the position at which motor vehicles stop before entering the
roadway.

"Thus, riding in the center of the traffic lane provides addi­tional time for the bicyclist to initiate evasive action once it becomes apparent that a motor vehicle is going to enter the roadway. The authors believe that the following important questions must be answered before it is possible to recommend that bicyclists be taught to ride in the center of the traffic lane.

* Would riding in the center of the traffic lane increase the likelihood of detection by a margin that has practical significance?

* Would riding in the center of the traffic lane increase the bicyclist's preview time by a margin that has practical significance?

* How would traffic efficiency be affected if riding in the center of the traffic lane became a common practice?

* Should riding in the center of the traffic lane be prohibited on some types of roadways and/or during certain time periods? If so, what types of roadways and what time periods?

* Should young bicyclists and/or slow-moving bicycles be permitted to ride in the center of the traffic lane? If not, what is the cutoff age/speed?"

If there's an answer to these questions, please let me know. I have never seen it. I'll post it if I get a good answer.

Thus, overall, I do think that the idea of a cycling safety course based on the data is a good idea, but have we ever seen one?

I have not. The ones I have seen like cycling savvy have misinformation all over them, and they seem to made to appeal to a small part of the population who wants to seem more elite than the rest of us sad sacks.

I mean I shudder at the whole notion of taking the lane because I think it's totally inconsiderate. Of course, they'd probably tell me that I'm an idiot for having manners or something. 

Also, the double standard arises, regarding classes versus facilities. This is because do we seen any moves to license the class by the government? No. Is there a law that expressly makes the classes legal? No.

Finally, do we see any mention, in this study, to the "rights to the road"? No.

Another shibboleth that we waste a ton of time on is the number of "turning conflicts that facilities cause." 

Looking at the Cross study, we realize that this is total nonsense.

Of all the types of fatalities caused by cyclists, 2.4% are caused by motorists going through an intersection and hitting a cyclist.

In fact, out of the 5 categories of Class C accidents, only two yield any deaths at all. Yet there are a great number of collisions for this type of accident as would be expected when vehicles come into conflict with one another.

This is where the VC people make a classic bait and switch where they confuse collisions with lethality then they pretend that all collisions are deadly.

Page 211-212"

"The vast majority of collisions occurred shortly after the motorist accelerated from a stopped position. This fact accounts for the low inci­dence of fatalities for Class C accidents. When the motor vehicle struck the bicycle, the impact velocity was low and the bicyclist usually careened off the front of the motor vehicle. When the bicyclist struck the motor vehicle, the impact velocity was solely a function of the bicyclist's speed.

Apparently, the bicycle speed was not often great enough to produce fatal injuries.Because of the low incidence of fatal accidents, Class C accidents must be considered less important than other types of accidents that account for fewer accidents but more fatal injuries."


Thus, it is clear from Cross' study that if you were going to increase cyclist safety, you'd argue against taking the lane (untested still), against "rights to the road", in favor of facilities, and for classes that taught one to ride where the least number of deaths were observed and not merely to satisfy an ideology.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Let A Thousand Flowers Bloom</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The title is from a Mao quote where, for a brief time, he loosened up the speech codes thinking that this would lead to many poems written about the brilliance of Communist China. Instead, he got lots of criticism about his regime.

Some people feel, from the beginning, his plan was to trick his opponents out into the open so he could arrest them.

What does this have to do with cycling?

Nothing really except that I do like the title, and I see it as a metaphor for what California, and the rest of the United States would look like if we had the courage to loosen up our planning codes to allow engineers to truly innovate.

Many people make the stupid comparison of government and the private sector. However, I do feel that in this particular case, the government can learn from private industry. 

Imagine if the engineers at Apple Computers had the same rigid "design codes" that the traffic engineers have. We would all be staring at blocky green cursors on black screens as text crawled across the screen from a 2400 baud modem.

American bikeways are now at the same kind of shitty standard that computers were forty years ago. I think that is, in part, because we don't allow our engineers to have the full creative expression that they need to truly shine.

One of the reasons for these regressive attitudes is based on fear for the safety of cyclists due to confusion that all road users will have when confronted with innovations.

I think that this fear is largely unfounded.

Humans are more intelligent than that. Also, one of the best innovations that the roads are lacking is intuitiveness. Just as a radically new iPhone is more intuitive to use than the safer and well trod DOS, newer road designs will be more intuitive for cyclists, motorists, and pedestrians. 

Initially, there will be a shock, but this is more of a safety shock than a collision producing one. When confronted with an innovation, motorist will be forced to slow down and to pay attention. This attentiveness will result in fewer not more collisions as one of the biggest contributors to motorway fatalities is driver inattentiveness.

Although the increase in safety and comfort for all is a huge advantage there are other benefits as well which is to make travel fun again.

A good friend of mine recounted it this way: she lived in a country where each state had not only different colored traffic signs but they were written in differing languages! Shortly after moving to the US, she took a road trip to a neighboring state. Imagine her dismay to realize that the state looked exactly same as the one before. With so much homogeneity, what's the use of travel at all?

Traveling by bicycle, however, she had a much different experience. Infrastructure for cycling was slightly different in each state. There were harried students squeezing by her into the door zone in college towns, to wine tours by bicycle in another, to a bike path in the golf ball zone in another. Finally, in many places there was the unfortunate smelly and noisy shoulder of the boring and homogenous highway.

How many places have we gotten off an exit of a freeway and saw the same cluster of chains along side a fast paced arterial road and wondered why are we even here? 

Now imagine every town being different with different styles of cycle tracks, round abouts, buffered bike lanes, biking boulevards, and even rope bridges across canyons for bicycles only. 

Where are people going to come for tourism? What towns will people talk about, start businesses in, and want to raise their children in?

People like to whine about how high New York rent is, but there, more than anywhere else, you get what you pay for. New York has world class talent in every field because it has built the infrastructure that draws those people there and keeps them there. Why do you think that they are building all this biking stuff anyway?

Hint, it's because they really know how to take care of their residents, and they are not afraid to spend money to do so. In fact, one might argue that this kind of government spending actually increases the tax base because it attracts wealthier residents to live and spend their money there.

Where else do you see such wealthy people living in apartments and walking the streets? In other places, walking is seen for the poor only.

So I urge the state of California to get off its ass and to stop standing in the way of innovation. We wasted forty or so years while the rest of the world surpassed us.

Instead of trying to ape Amsterdam, let's up our game and have them coming here to learn for us. Sure there are lots of intelligent Dutch and Danish engineers so it's a worthy competition. Let's see who can build the most bicycle friendly city.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I was actually serious. 

I have no idea why people think that this is impossible.

Let's recall that there was a time when the automobile was the plaything of the rich and that politicians could get good traction by campaigning against it.

Smoking in a hospital was allowed.

Things change, and it's best if we have a hand in thme so we can make things better.

We used to not have a freeway system. When it was built, many whined that it was too expensive and impractical.

If we don't dream big, we get nothing which was where we have been in the last few decades of cycling infrastructure.

And yes, I am not ashamed to admire the parts of Europe that are admirable. And, like we took the freeway from Germany, we should take bike infrastructure from the Dutch then improve it.

Why do people think that America is so lame and backward that it can't lead the world in cycling?]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA["If we don’t dream big, we get nothing which was where we have been in the last few decades of cycling infrastructure."  

Trying for Dutch infrastructure is dreaming big.  One reason we didn't dream big in the past is because no one knew what was possible*.  Even for those who visited and rode in the the Netherlands, it was difficult to comprehend the extent and details of what they experienced, and hard to communicate the portion they did understand.  The Dutch didn't even realize how advanced their system is.

But that is no longer true.  The best cycling infrastructure in the world is, thanks to many individuals and the internet, accessible, visible, and reproducible.  hembrow.blogspot.com for example.  But more people need to see it/read it.

*(Another reason is the prolific,counter-productive, and on-going influence of the Forrester/VC/CABO crowd telling us that what we want is not really what we want.)]]></wp:comment_content>

Yes, the Netherlands is wonderful, and it makes an excellent starting point.

But I see no reason to limit ourselves to what I see there. I wish we would stop the liability/segregation/poverty/safety nonsense and allow our engineers a big budget not unlike the one that got us the first freeway system.

I believe that only in taking risks and spending money can we truly make things safe and save money in the long run.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Imagine if there was a group of people who had superior skills regarding to cycling so that they could do so in such a way as to make it much safer.

Should we listen to this group?

The vast majority of cyclists says "NO!" In fact, they flat out ignore this group.

Why?

Because they are women of course.

How do I really know that these cyclists are the most "competent" of them all?

Let's look at the facts. After all, just going on our own "superstitions", we'd never learn anything! 

Women account for only 40% of cyclists nationally, but they make up only 10% of the fatalities. Men on the other hand, are 60% of the total, but are 90% of the fatalities. Thus, women are less likely, even when their smaller total numbers are factored out, to die when cycling.

But who are the chest thumping bike xperts? (sic) :)

Men!

So here's the thing. Why the hell would I listen to someone who is more likely to die?

I shouldn't.

We really don't know _why_ women are less likely to die, and we probably never will because, like I said, nobody listens to women. 

We'd rather continue to die in larger numbers while mocking the safer sex.

I do have a theory on why women are in less accidents, and that is because they ride more intelligently.

In order to promote bicycle safety, I'm going to advocate riding more like women.

Other idiots can continue to ride their own made up ways, but I'm going to peddle down the path of wisdom.

Here are some of my preliminary findings in the wonderful, innovation I call "listening to women".

Notice that these are all tendencies and the opinions of the women cyclists that I have spoken with and read about. Thus, there are going to be women who ride the exact same as the prototypical male. If this offends you, please close your browser window now. I'm not here to offend, but merely to collect data to keep myself alive.

Women tend to ride only when they feel comfortable. Other morons call this "superstitious" or whatever, but guess what, the proof's in the pudding. 

Women don't tend to look at made up "crash diagrams" nor do they obsess over door zones or the dangers of sidewalk riding. 

They go out of their way to ride longer routes which are quieter and avoid heavy, loud traffic.

They wear what they want.

If riding is too hard or scary, they just won't ride at all which probably accounts, in part, for their lower numbers of cyclists. This also happens to be one of the cornerstones of Cross' conclusions. Be very careful on what roads you ride on. Don't be bold. Don't ride too fast. 

And overall, if you aren't part of the safer sex who rides like the safer sex, shut up about safety. The numbers are against you, and whatever you say is bound to be wrong and just get people hurt.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[No, I didn't consider it. Thanks for bringing that up. The data is fairly messy and incomplete.

On the other hand, to say that men ride more or they ride in worse places, definitively, needs more data.

Honest criticism is welcome, but often we have the situation where speculation and criticism are seen as on par with the facts. This, I can not accept.

Also, the female cyclists I know, can kick an average man's ass in distance and risk taking. I was introduced to fixies by a woman. I was taught most of what I know on bike repair by a woman--several actually.

Finally, I feel that if the stats went the other way, there wouldn't be so many details of the study put under a microscope. Rather it would be accepted that of course men are better riders.

I just wanted to point out that women have much to teach, and that one should show some kind of data to back up one's supposed expertise.

The data so far shows that women are safer. I'm eager for more information on this topic--not to have the boring men vs. women thing--I like both--but to teach us all to ride more safely and comfortably.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for commenting. I appreciate it. 

I'd like to elaborate on how I think that biology plays in bicycle safety.

I do like biology (I minored in it), and the way that our animal bodies affect our minds and decision making process.

That being said, ee may or may not be hardwired to preserve females. I'm really not sure about a lot of what goes on for biology of the sexes, and "just so stories". I have found that a broader study of cultures shows a diversity that contradicts nearly everything that we believe is "hardcoded" regarding maleness, femaleness, and sexuality. Humans, especially our minds, are far more plastic than most of us know.

I mean, we can argue (quite wrongly) that men don't listen to women because men tend to be stronger and more violent.

For me, that's not been the case as I know very many strong women and lots of weak men (and the reverse, too).

Also, it's a shitty way to run society in an unequal way due to these stories. The point was, whatever the reason, we should listen to women more.

I would say that it's tautological that women take less risks. By definition less risk results in less injury.

On the other hand, I am not sure whether there's something special about women's biology that men can not learn from.

I just thought it was ironic that most bicycle safety gurus are from the riskier sex. 

I would love to see women put together a bicycle safety course for me based on what how they ride. Though I speculated on why women are safer, I really don't know the reason which is why I say that more research is warranted.

Obviously, as a man, there's not a lot I can do to get this research going.

I'm eager to hear the results and to take the class.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Ecology of Rights</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the more useful ideas that I have come across, recently in my reading, is called ecology of ideas.

This has nothing to do with nature, but everything to do with how useful an idea is to promoting your goals. When you ask whether an idea is ecological, you aren't asking whether the idea is true.

It's not that ecological ideas are necessarily false, but rather sometimes our obsession with the truth can get in the way of the useful.

Many un-ecological phrases are also examples of loaded language:

"Loaded words and phrases have strong emotional implications and involve strongly positive or negative reactions beyond their literal meaning."

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loaded_language

One example of this is "rights to the road".

This is a useless phrase because it doesn't really mean anything.

It does sound good, in a vague way. Who would be against "rights to the road" by a totalitian or patriarch. 

However, it would be better for the rights to be spelled out more specifically like I did in a previous post. Also, it's nice if we could see specifically _why_ these rights are so important.

Right now, I do _not_ feel like I have the right to ride my bicycle many places. That is, I feel that there are many jobs that I will NOT be able to get to by bicycle.

Even new laws specifically allowing me to ride on the roads that get there won't help much. 

Another un-ecological phrase is "motorist education". Again, who would be against education?

However, things fall apart when you look at the details. What does education, in this context, mean? Is there as specific class that motorists will have to take? When will they take it? How will we ensure that they will take it? What's taught in the class? When will 100% of motorists be "educated".

Right now, to my knowledge, cyclist education, for motorists is 100% voluntary and there is no government body which oversees said education. Thus is totally non-standard. Thus, without knowing who's educatated or with what, we have no idea how to judge whether this is a good idea.

As it stands, "motorist education" is a soft and vague way of deflecting complaints that motorists suck to be close to when on a bicycle. If someone complains that motorists harass you for taking the lane or that a stretch is too dangerous because you keep getting buzzed, some "cycling advocates" will say that "motorists need education" rather than putting in to effect something with more teeth which will actually solve the problem. 

The real hope is that you, and your complaint, go away and we continue with life as usual with said advocates not riding on the stretch of road that sucks for you, because they have cars, and can choose when and where to ride.

Another pointless phrase is "door zone". Where is this exactly? We know that if you get hit by a door "doored" you were riding too far into the "door zone". However, car doors are variable in length. Thus the door zone is really not a rectangular "zone", but rather a fuzzy area which changes with parking patterns. For example, if there's a semi truck parked in front of a smart car, you might have to go further out into the lane to avoid crashing into the corner of the semi. However, if you are in the same location when riding next to the smart car, you are still out of range of its door.

The silliest thing about the door zone is that it's often given as an exact distance where you are "safe to ride". However, it's absurd that one can keep one's bicycle straight. Even if you could, unless you ride out into the center of the travel lane, you will be in the "door zone" some time or another.

The problem with "door zone" is also that it implies that there are locations which are particularly dangerous on the road. However, studies have shown that people get hit in every single location on the road. Thus, splitting up the road into arbitrary zones is not really helpful in ascertaining a safe place to ride because we don't know a safe place.

This is because even when designations such as "travel lane" are given, we still can't be sure exactly where each cyclist was and the other circumstances of his accident. As I said before, you can get hit by a car while sitting in your house. It's not common, but it's possible.

Finally, with the door zone, when someone gets doored, we blame the cyclist. We don't ask for more "motorist education". On the other hand, if the same cyclist is rear ended, we don't blame him for riding in the road, but rather we try to find some other cause for his death or we start to talk about how if you do the math in a certain way, this is an unlikely event.

Thus, "door zone" is an arbitrary phrase which is usually used against cyclists sometimes to make us look stupid other times to justify our deaths.

Another useless phrase that is going out of fashion is "competent cyclist."

Again, since cyclist safety is in its infancy, especially in the US, there are no real experts on cycling riding. At best there are people who are experienced, Sadly, many experienced and intelligent cyclists report that they feel that the more they cycle, the less safe they think that they are riding because they take more chances due to less fear. So experience might not be all that it's cracked up to be for riding. Statistics are also not much help as we said before. Thus, outside of speculation--which many people love to do, including me--there's no real way saying what's safe and what's not.

The more honest people say that they don't know, there are no "cycling experts".

Also, note that cyclists are 10x more likely to be killed in accidents per trip mile than motorists. Why don't we have the phrase "incompetent motorists"?

Pedestrians are even more likely to die than cyclists per trip mile. Why not say "incompetent pedestrian"? Mainly because it's stupid, but the same can be said for cycling unless you want to create a convoluted argument against infrastructure.

I suggest that since our roads suck for cycling, there is no real safe way of riding. At best, we can avoid certain roads, especially "rural roads" at night. 

Thus, another useless phrase is "with proper education, a cyclist can ride safely anywhere". Most data shows that this is a total fabrication as some roads are more inherently dangerous than others.

Along these lines is another meaningly combination of words which is "normal flow of traffic." It's often said that we can't have cycling infrastructure because it interupts the "normal flow of traffic."

Well, everything interupts traffic. Flowing traffic isn't the point; the point is to get from point A to point B. To make this safer and more efficient, we have traffic lights, drive ways, and parking lots. In each of these, a motorists interupts the "normal flow of traffic."

Also, traffic isn't naturual, it's created by humans. Thus, it's up to humans to decide what is "normal" for their creation. We used to not have freeways. When the first one was built, would it have been legitimate to argue that this was not normal? People would have laughed. Thus, to say that anything interupts "normal" traffic flow is just silly.

Overall, there are many nonsensical phrases we hear around cycling. They are strongly worded so we must agree with the phrases. Otherwise, we are incomptents who are against rights and education and thus we urge people ride in the door zone and away from rural roads. ]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Micro-violations</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[OK, before I post this, you should see this amazing
<a href="http://bikinginla.wordpress.com/2012/01/22/analyzing-2011-socal-cycling-fatalities-los-angeles-and-door-zones-may-be-safer-than-you-think/">data analysis.</a>

You should probably read this whole blog before wasting time on my ramblings. This is truly a landmark blog.

OK, you're back. I trust that you have read all of Biking in LA. :)

There is this are where I ride where people are turning from a rural road onto a freeway. Each and every driver rides across the double yellow lines.

This is funny to me for many reasons. One is that that I have to dash across the intersection, as it is, because the cars come down the rural road so fast, it's almost as if they come out of nowhere. Also, it's funny because there are people who claim that "nobody will cross a double yellow line, because it's illegal, which is why motorists have to buzz cyclists on certain roads."

Yeah right.

There's another reason why I think it's funny that people cross the double lines and that is because it's totally harmless.

Very few cyclist go through this area, and the ones that do can take evasive action, like ride the wrong way, if they really need to get through this intersection.

This started me thinking of the notion of micro-violations. Note, that I'm not a lawyer, blah, blah, blah. This is merely an idea of my own that I just invented.

The idea is that there are some things that are illegal and are really dangerous like blowing through a stop sign in front of a school. 

I know people are in a hurry, and so on, but hello, children! There's a giant school right in front of you so stop, completely, for these stop signs even if it's after school hours because many schools have play grounds that are used even at night.

On the other hand, like above, where people blow over a double yellow line, this is harmless.

Many violotions of cyclists, are similarly harmless.

Yet the government treats all violations the same. Worse, many people also treat these violations as the same.

This whole idea is why there are suggestions for changing the law so that it's more in harmony with what's actually necessary and safe rather than just blindly and mindless following arbitrary laws.

One last thing.

We are so obsessed with interection violations, we have red light cameras. As per above, I say rightly so.

But now rear ending is incresing. In fact, if you google rear ending statistics, they are totally obsessed about a minor increase in rear endings at red light cameras. The idea is that red light cameras are "dangerous".

Maybe, but I think that the solution to this problem is to make the lanes more narrow near the red light so that people ride slower. Also, they can ticket tail gating more. I have never seen a ticket for tail gating, only speeding. But tail gating, in many places, can be just as dangerous.

Also, while speeding is just inconsiderate and irresponsible, tail gating is a form of agression and bullying.

If we just accept that most motorists will be incompetent and irresponsible, we can, at least, pull the licenses of those who are hostile.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[There are lots of groups who promise to do things which are "good for cycling", but I have to ask, what does this really mean?

For me, this means four things: safety, efficiency, comfort, and mode share.

If something does not contribute to these things, I am not interested.

1. Safety is not as easy to understand as people may think. This is because it's difficult to determine how many people are riding. Thus, to measure safety a census is necessary. I feel that this should be done in the next US census to get better data. Also, better crash data is needed.

Also, people make divergent predictions on what will make us safe. However, I find that the best way to determine this is to study places that are all ready safe and to find out what they do.

Increased safety for bicycles should mean increased safety for motoring and pedestrians, too.

2. Efficiency means how quickly and easily we can cycle. This means cycling freeways and paths with fewer junctions with motor vehicles. This means less hills or mitigation strategies on par with freeways which means 6% or less EVERYWHERE. This is far less expensive than building a new freeway and way more fun!

Efficient cycling should mean more efficient walking and motoring, too.

3. Comfort is related to efficiency and less hills, but also with less fear. Additionally, cycling should be more quiet and less smelly with less burning petrol odors.

Finally, we can do things like wrapping polls to make them less dangerous, give foot rests at curbs when we stop, or even handles for resting on.

When it comes to comfort, the sky's the limit.

4. Mode share means increasing the number of people who cycle. This will be a natural result of the first three points. More mode share will actually also reinforce the top three points because more cyclists will want more safety, efficiency, and comfort and they will vote them for themselves.

I mainly want higher mode share, however, because I want more people to ride so everyday I am surrounded by beautiful cyclists of all ages, races, and walks of life.

One day, we will all leave our thunderdome view of cycling behind.

This is my vision for the future.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Making Stuff Up (Or Cycling Risk Science 101)</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/01/30/making-stuff-up-or-cycling-risk-science-101/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[When I first started riding my bicycle, I thought that the main challenge was balancing.

Oh, was I wrong!

The main obstacle for cycling safely is cars.

Most cycling deaths are caused by getting hit by a car.

This should be obvious.

However, I wasn't really sure HOW to ride safely.

How did I learn?

I just mainly rode for about ten years. While riding, I payed attention. 

However, I am not really sure how well I am doing. All my ideas on why I did things were my own ideas.

To this day, I just ride in a way to try to stay out of traffic as much as possible. I try to make eye contact so I don't get t-boned, but overall, I do NOT assume that motorists see me.

In the absence of data, I considered riding style to be a personal preference.

Then I learned that there were people who claimed that they knew how to ride safely and smoothly, being calm in ANY road condition.

I'm not a genius, but I do know that when I see absolutes like ANY (or NEVER), my bullshit detector goes off.

Overall, I just felt that there were some roads that are dangerous, period, and there's nothing that I can do to help myself.

As it turns out, there are a lot of people who disagree with me.

They call themselves various names which can be googled.

Overall, I think that cycling safety is a great idea. We need to learn as much as we can to keep ourselves safe.

But I do object to having cycling safety absolve all others of their need to do things safely. That is, roads can be made safer; we can have bike lanes, and so on.

Turns out that some clever diagrams were used to disprove these amazing pieces of infrastructure. 

Doesn't matter if it works or not, we have these amazing graphics showing us all these "conflict points".

Sounds spiffy and quite convincing.

However, I thought that real world data was more important.

No, I was told, "coorelation does not equal causation". 

Ah, I guess those five words are the magic wand that makes all traffic data vanish into a cloud of uncertainty. What is left is these beautiful diagrams based purely on speculation.

Hmm, I don't want them to have all the fun.

I am a good writer, myself, can't I get into the act?

I guess I can because I am!

Here's my idea: I'm going to make up a bunch of bullshit, but scientific sounding terms then by the powers of speculation, I'll breathe them to life.

Here's an example: conflict area or CA.

Conflict area is the amount of time that someone is in danger of being hit by a car. Basically, you can get hit by a car in your house so the idea is that you want to be in a "less likely to die" conflict area than in a greater conflict area.

If one conflict area is safer than another than, we can say you are "safe". By safe, I mean safer than if you were in a greater conflict zone.

For example, the difference between your house (non-conflict area) and the street (conflict zone). Also, the conflict area is an area in terms of geometry thus the units are meters squared.

Got it?

Another notion is probable accidents or PA's. A probable accident is a likely accident that can kill you. For example, being rear ended. The units for PA is in integers.

If you multiply the PA x CA you get the risk in the units of PA x m^2.

Next, we have ITD which is incidences to die. This is the number of things that must happen before you actually die.

For example, you can be rear ended and die right away (ITD=1), but if you get doored, you will most likely die only if you get hit by a car. Thus it's twice as likely (or more) that you will die by being straight up rear ended than by being doored. Thus dooring has an ITD=2.

The smarter readers realize that we are going to divide by ITD. 

Thus we get the chance of dying in any location as:

(PA/ITD) x m^2

Now we're cooking with gas!

Future blog posts will use these ridiculous, made up variables to real world data to get nonsensical conclusions.

Stay tuned.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm not a libertarian because I think that their views are mainly selfish and show a lack of understanding of human nature.

However, I do like one of their sayings which is "My rights begin where your rights end."

To me, this means that I can do whatever I want as long as I don't take your rights away.

That usually works except when it comes to motor vehicle traffic.

Here's the thing. I really want dedicated cycling infrastructure.

Not because I can't all ready use the roads, anyone can ride their bike on a well formed road.

The main reason is that automobiles are annoying and scary.

The thing is that NOBODY thinks of them as being the problem.

Everytime you have a safety lesson, it's where the victim didn't take care of themselves.

It's a total blame of the victim.

For example, we are responsible for wearing bright clothes.

Why?

Because if we don't, motorists might kill us.

That's pretty harsh, don't you think? Death for the wrong wardrobe? Sounds like a backward, and insane religious theocracy.

But no, we are _different_ from an insane, theocracy because we don't mean to kill you, it's an accident.

Really? How so?

Before you get into a car, you know it's dangerous. Streets are not inherently safe for pedestrians and cyclists.

If they were, I wouldn't have to continuously live in a state of paranoia like I do now.

I'll repeat this, I live in a constant state of paranoia not unlike a child in a war zone who has to watch out for mine zones, stray bullets, and sexual predator soldiers.

Can you just walk into any street without looking, wearing black with no lights and be safe?

Why not?

Because you will be killed.

I think I should have the right to NOT be killed. I don't think it's reasonable that I have to mitigate the problems that automobiles cause. Making me constantly having to check and double check for some moron on their cell phone is IMPINGING ON MY RIGHTS.

Which rights?

Well don't I have a reasonable right to live?

Another example is disease. Disease is caused by nature and we have drugs and immunizations to lessen the risk.

Wild animals are another problem that humans have greatly reduced.

So why is the US government spending billions to make it more likely for us to die if we don't dress a certain way and look around all the time like scared mice?

It should be the responsibility to each individual to mitigate the harm that they cause. 100% mitigated, not 50% not 10%.

That means, I should NEVER hear a car engine if I don't want. I should never have to look around for a car. I should never have to carry lights and all kinds of other crap on my bicycle if I don't want to.

But it's really hard to mitigate automobile related problems.

So what?

It's hard for me to control myself when walking by someone eating an  ice cream cone but that doesn't make it OK for me to take their ice cream.

But the economy will collapse if I don't pollute as much as possible.

Really?

I'd like to meet this economy person who is the scape goat for other people's selfishness.

From what I learned, "economy" meant exchanging goods and services in an mutually beneficially way. I see no benefit to noise, smoke, and death. Perhaps I'm stupid or I am looking at smog at all the wrong ways. Most people think that traffic noises are awesome which is why I see people picnicing right along the 8. :)

The point is that I don't have the answers. But I get really angry when people create a shitty situation for me then they bitch when we have to spend a fraction of their subsidies on mitigating the problem that they created in the first place.

So the next time someone moans about the high cost of facilities say "no" that's the high cost of our auto-centric world. Facilities for bicycle and pedestrians, only, would be a fraction of the cost of the auto-centric infrastructure. I mean the cost of socialized housing for cars, aka free parking, alone could pay for significant improvements in our infrastructure.]]></content:encoded>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I'll write more on this later; this is a rant, but it's probably the most important thing I'll ever say on this blog.

Long time readers all ready know that I hate the whole notion of <a href="http://bostonbiker.org/2011/12/29/relevant-repost-why-vehicular-cycling-failed-or-how-i-learned-to-love-the-bike-lane/">
Vehicular</a><a href="http://seattletransitblog.com/2011/08/26/seattle-weekly-bike-lobby-the-new-kkk/"> Cycling</a>,<a href="http://bikinginla.wordpress.com/2012/01/12/is-an-anti-bike-fraud-being-committed-in-your-name/"> CABO</a>, and more. 

I have many, many allies in this. Pretty much 100% of motorists and the vast majority of cyclists all agree that infrastructure is necessary to make cycling a serious transportation means.

However, we run into problems when our allies unwitting undermine us.

How is that?

Now, if you read old posts, you'll see that I, too, am guilty of this mistake, but it stops here.

Please, never say, again things like: 

1. "Forester had good ideas for his time."

No, he didn't. He misread a study and created a program which used fear, uncertainty, and doubt to hold cycling back.

None of these things were ever good ideas.

2. "I ride VC."

I don't know how people ride, but I suspect that people who have not had a cycling safety course do not ride VC. Riding in traffic is NOT riding VC. Riding in a safe way from experience is NOT VC.

VC is the notion that you are driving a car when you really are riding a bike.

This is delusional.

3.  "VC is a safe way for me to ride in current conditions."

Long time readers know that this statement is broken in many ways. First of all, what is "safe"? If "safe" means teaching people to fight, politically, what has saved lives in other places, then yes, VC is "safe".

Read the stats and weep. The door zone is not as dangerous as they say. Bright colors and flashy lights don't protect you. The sidewalk isn't the death trap it's made to be.

I can go on, but the point is that instead of these phrases, we need to start saying some things that are more useful.

1. VC is a terrible idea, even in the 70's. It's a dangerous way to ride, and the classes that encourage this style give people a false sense of security by having them deny their normal instincts and emotions.

2. A bike safety course will NEVER make one as safe as proper infrastructure. We actually would like to see better statistics on current practices to learn how to ride safely.

3. Nobody rides VC. Nobody. Outside of some staged movies, the vast majority of cyclists learns from trial and error which is good as it's our genetic heritage. Things suck now because cyclists can't have harmless collisions (error) because the roads are inherently dangerous. Thus, riding (trials) are decreased, and this actually discourage the education of the public.

True education occurs on the roads, alone, at night without lights (necessarily) in all forms of weather.

When people first start riding they learn that the streets are louder, scarier, and filled with anonymous and hostile machines which could kill them at the slightest mistake. 

Is this the lesson we want our children to learn? Is this the world we want to leave them?

Look around, and you'll see very few cyclists riding alone in the middle of a high speed lane up a hill around a bend. They won't last long there.

4. No infrastructure, no rights. Just as allowing modern motor cars to drive up and down the natural sides of a mesas is empty as a right because it's impossible, it's equally impossible to claim that cyclists have equal rights now.

Until the paths for cyclists are the same or shorter than for cars, until the grade we have to climb is the same or shorter than for cars, until the death rate for cyclists is equal to or less than for cars, until the amount of money spent by the government is equal to or more than for cars, we aren't equal.

Right now, a bicycle is as free as a typewriter in Soviet Russia. Sure you can type anything you want, but if you do, you may die for that right. 

I can't wait to read what you write while obsessing over the Gulag.

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[You present the false notion--aided by not providing a working definition of VC for the purposes of your rebuttal of it--that VC and infrastructure are mutually exclusive. Your points imply that VC and cycling education are one and the same and because not everybody can or will ride VC that therefore it is dangerous for anyone to have any cycling education, that everyone should remain ignorant and figure it out on their own. 

You cannot rebut "I ride VC [and it works for me]" with "some other people don't so it doesn't work for anybody." 

You're alienating any of your readers who are potential allies and do ride VC with overstatements like "Nobody rides VC. Nobody." Reading between the lines surrounding this statement, you're really saying that nobody rides VC except the people who do, and people who ride VC aren't 'real cyclists' (or people, apparently). I think that's pretty ironic because the subset of more vocal VC advocates who are somewhat over-the-top (the ones with whom you group in the rest of us who ride and promote VC techniques as one tool among many) also suggest that people who don't ride their way aren't 'real cyclists'. Yes, let's continue to divide the cycling community.

I ride VC, and it works very well for me. It's not the most fun to ride on streets with heavy traffic, but VC helps me get the job done. The feedback I got from my cycling instructor has literally saved my life, in one case allowing me to completely avoid being a part of a three-car collision from a drunk driver (in the middle of the night, I might add, where those three cars were the only ones on the road). 

When I learned to drive a car, I applied the same principles I use when riding a bike, and they are quite transferable.

I am a strong supporter of cycling infrastructure and education. I am a strong believer that motorists on this continent are given a free ride when it comes to respecting other road users. It is ridiculous to suggest that everyone who practices or promotes vehicular cycling in any circumstance (or by grouping and labeling these people "VC" in the first place) is suggesting it's the only way to ride in any circumstance. Yes, it would be nice if every bike route were safe, but the fact is they aren't all. VC techniques can help those people who aren't riding on the 90% of their route that does have comfortable infrastructure because 10% of the route doesn't. More people cycling on that 10% will build a constituency for political support to fix its physical deficiencies.

Similarly, just because a "VC" person opposes a piece of infrastructure it doesn mean they're opposed to all infrastructure. If a separated bike lane dumps people into the blind uphill turn you mentioned, that isn't safe. I know a number of "anti-VC" people who would nonetheless support it because lanes that make things more dangerous because hey, infrastructure dedicated to cycling must make cycing safer, right?

I look forward to seeing how you misinterpret and spin my comments to demonstrate how I want all cyclists to die, or that because I support cycling intrastructure I'm therefore defined out of the VC category.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA["You present the false notion–aided by not providing a working definition of VC for the purposes of your rebuttal of it–that VC and infrastructure are mutually exclusive."

Um, please go read _Effective Cycling_. Or read this evidence here: google.com. There you'll find plenty of evidence that shows that the VC crowd has fought infrastructure. 

For now, VC and education are pretty much the same. Again, do your research. They even call it "riding vehicularly." I am trying to put together a non-VC class and to get it approved by the government. It will teach how to ride in bike lanes and on the sidewalk. Want to help me?

Haha, alienating readers. I don't care about this.

I am here to write things that people are too afraid to say. I am here to look at all the information and give my best opinion...with jokes.

If you want to "not be alienated" please don't read this blog. Thanks, though, for helping me make a disclaimer.

By saying that "nobody rides VC", I mean to say that I NEVER see people perfectly executing the moves that our outlined in _Effective Cycling_. I am trying to find them because I think that they exist. Mostly the spandex racers are on the shoulder or on the OB bicycle PATH.

And a peleton does NOT count. Anyone can be brave with 20 of their friends.

"Yes, let’s continue to divide the cycling community."

The bicycle community has been divided for 30 years. There were less than 1% of us who spoke for pro-VC views to the govt. Then there was the 99% plus who wanted to ride but were too scared and we thought (wrongly) that the govt wanted us not to ride. This is another VC lie.

When I am defensive "Forrester had good ideas for the time" this will be abused by VC people. Instead, we need to take the fight home and destroy their base, forever. Only then will we get infrastructure. Or you can live for "peace at any price" and let them to continue to run the terms of debate. My mind is made up on what needs to be done.

BTW, does anyone read this blog? No. Does it determine public policy? No. This is for me and my friends to cache my stats and to tell some jokes.

"It is ridiculous to suggest that everyone who practices or promotes vehicular cycling in any circumstance (or by grouping and labeling these people “VC” in the first place) is suggesting it’s the only way to ride in any circumstance."

Which is why I never said that.

"I ride VC, and it works very well for me."

For the love of God, please STOP SAYING THAT. You have no idea how damaging that is to cycling in the US. Please read some more and wake up!

"When I learned to drive a car, I applied the same principles I use when riding a bike, and they are quite transferable."

No they are not. I'm not going to itemize the differences but they are enough so that the law in all 50 states does not equate the two. In fact, trucks and cars differ legally, too. Only VC brainwashing could force me to make such obvious statements to someone over 5 years old.

"Yes, it would be nice if every bike route were safe, but the fact is they aren’t all."

Yes, and I personally blame the VC nuts for this. ONLY.

"Similarly, just because a “VC” person opposes a piece of infrastructure it doesn mean they’re opposed to all infrastructure."

Yes, they are. This is another lie they tell. Trust me, they will pretend to be for it get on a committee and stab us in the back. I saw this happen, for real, many, many times before I came to the conclusions I came to.

"I know a number of “anti-VC” people who would nonetheless support it because lanes that make things more dangerous because hey, infrastructure dedicated to cycling must make cycing safer, right?"

Wrong. Nobody supports making things more dangerous except for those who want to dedicate all the money to motoring, only. If you hadn't noticed they just passed a bill which would make that much easier on the federal level. Please wake up.

"I look forward to seeing how you misinterpret and spin my comments to demonstrate how I want all cyclists to die, or that because I support cycling intrastructure I’m therefore defined out of the VC category."

I will not do that. This is called "mind reading" and it's a sign of distorted thinking. If you'd read all my posts, you'd see how I talk about this.

It's impossible to tell what people want, inside their heads. I would like to talk about what decisions, in the real world, I actually saw. Plus jokes! :)]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[If you think that cycling sucks, don't do it.

If it's great, do it.

I'm not going to tell you to risk your life by riding VC.

My approach is that VC is dangerous and you should NEVER ride that way.

BTW, I'm NOT here to help people.

If Forrester can help you then use his advice.

I'm sorry that I gave you the impression that I was here to help you.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I commute by bicycle every day in Phoenix, AZ, which has an official bicycle commute rate of .7%, pathetic. The city actually has about 500 miles of bike lanes and paths, mainly painted lanes plus canal paths, with a few multi-use paths, so some effort has been made toward bike infrastructure, possibly far from enough to have a positive impact though, and the implementation has been inconsistent and uncoordinated. I would like nothing more than for separate bicycle infrastructure in Phoenix that was crowded with happy, fashionable cyclists just riding around rather than driving autos everywhere. Currently, though, to get to work each day, I end up riding on streets full of cars. In that environment, I find techniques that are actually useful for me in Forester, but not much in this post that helps me: how to ride on a street full of cars where there is no infrastructure, how to turn left, how to get across, and so on. I'm totally open to other usable ideas about how I should ride to work on Monday morning in Phoenix, if you have better suggestions than VC. I'm asking this in a constructive spirit, since I too would like to leave something better for my children than a paved over parking lot basking in the heat of global warming. But also, I plan to keep riding my bicycle to work in Phoenix every day. Help me understand what I should do differently from VC the day after tomorrow when I ride into work.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I would never ride VC, and I certainly would never allow any child or Grandchild of mine to learn VC.

Riding VC is lethal, and I would dearly love to see the figures of the deaths and seriously injured of whether they were riding VC or not.  I suspect the majority of them were.

VC is for the young, fit, active adrenalin junkies.  It is not for everyday people that want to get to school, arrive at work in their work clothes having not worked up a sweat.  It's not for shoppers, going to the doctors, hospital, or dentist.  It's not for sticking the kids or a dog on the back and going off to visit Grandma or Aunt Joan.  Nor is it for riding into town to meet a mate for coffee, going to the cinema or theatre.

Real bicyclists do not wear special clothes, ride a bike so far leaning over that they look contorted, nor do they feel the need to pedal furiously at a minimum speed of 20 mph, which is what I believe is recommended for VC.

Ordinary everyday, real, bicyclists will tend to cycle on the road where the road speeds are low and safe.  They will use cycle paths and lanes where provided.  And if they come to a junction or roundabout that they feel unsafe to use, they will either dismount and cross as a pedestrian, just as the highway code recommends, or they will mount the pavement and cycle across pedestrian crossings as a safe way to cross.

Real bicyclists will even break the law on very fast, dangerous roads and cycle on the pavement.  Very strangely the Home Office and police actually recognise this as normal and acceptable behaviour for real bicyclists.

Real bicyclists need real cycle infrastructure.

You see the real bicyclist is the ordinary, everyday, person that dons ordinary everyday clothes and then uses their bike for transport.  They do not dress specifically for the bike, they do not risk life and limb proving that they can get to work faster than a car. 

Any activity of any form that requires special equipment and clothing is a sport.  Vehicular Cycling is a sport.

For those that like the sport of VC then good luck to them, but they certainly shouldn't be falsely promoting that sport as safe everyday bicycling.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Putting the Streets Beneath a Microscope</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Before, I get started, I do believe that I had been referred to as an anti-VC "extremist". This made me so happy. Never before had I been declared so sane! :)

OK, more extremism coming up! :)

One of the biggest flaws in the VC movement is it's notion that we need to surpress cycling infrastructure because it will suck.

I was thinking of cycling in Copenhage, and the infrastructure there wasn't so great either. Also, a great speaker said that he toured the Netherlands, and that it too had infrstructure that had flaws. He went on to say that the standards for cycling infrastructure were better in the US than over there.

Despite this, places with more infrastructure makes things safer and cycling more popular. Thus, the VC movement confuses flawed infrastructure with dangerous riding.

This is a common problem in the <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2012/02/features/trials-and-errors?page=all">sciences.</a>

From the article: "This assumption -- that understanding a system's constituent parts means we also understand the causes within the system -- is not limited to the pharmaceutical industry or even to biology. It defines modern science. In general, we believe that the so-called problem of causation can be cured by more information. Scientists refer to this process as reductionism. By breaking down a process, we can see how everything fits together; the complex mystery is distilled into a list of ingredients."

Here the idea is that if we can make impressive looking diagrams with lots of "conflict points", we can decide how safe a street is. This doesn't hold up.

In fact, if you look at national crash data broken down by states, in the US, the older states tend to be safer for cycling and pedestrians. Thus, coorelation (new infrastructure) doesn't equal causation (of more safety). In fact, the inverse is true.

I had a similar experience the day that the power went off. Motorists were trapped for hours, apprently, as there was no power for traffic lights. On the other hand, for me, the commute was super-duper easy. One of the most comfortable commutes ever in San Diego. Thus, I realized that the whole system was actively--though unwittingly--working against me. The more energy put into the so-called "modern" transportation system, the shittier things are for cyclists. 

And people say that cyclists are equal if the government does nothing to help us.

Anyway, I didn't get to the point of this article which is in depth analysis, VC style, of a street where I look for conflict points and more.

Stay tuned. I'll get to this another day.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a continuation of my notion of the "microscope" which I talk about in earlier posts.

[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="614" caption="Turning Onto Ward Road"]<img class=" " title="Turning Onto Ward Road" src="http://i1143.photobucket.com/albums/n631/fredollinger/cimg2916.jpg" alt="Turning Onto Ward Road" width="614" height="461" />[/caption]

We begin our critique with this turn.

Note, that in the photo, I just made the turn and am looking back.

When I first made this turn, I would hug the curb. This is usually a safe choice, but here note how hard it is to see around the bend.

Thus, I would go into the middle of the first lane, one of the few places I would "control the lane".

Though the speed limit is 30 MPH, the cars would go to 50 MPH and buzz me. Worse, there was a door zone coming up.

[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="614" caption="Ward Rd: 50 MPH with Door Zone"]<img class=" " title="Ward Rd: 50 MPH with Door Zone" src="http://i1143.photobucket.com/albums/n631/fredollinger/cimg2915.jpg" alt="Ward Rd: 50 MPH with Door Zone" width="614" height="461" />[/caption]

Worse, there were people who would walk across the street, blithely without looking. Worse, there's a parking lot on the left side where people would drive out. They, too, could not see because of the parallel parking. Thus they, too, would accelerate to 50 MPH.

Thus, I can't ride in the "bike lane" above because people who don't want to pay for parking are storing their cars there. I can't ride in the door zone because people are constantly opening their doors on this stretch. Most cars ride in the right lane of the road and hug the gutter until the last second when they see the parked cars. At this point, they drive three feet or more away from the cars to allow fellow motorists to open their doors safely.

What's a poor cyclist to do?

I actually take the LEFT lane. When traffic comes behind me, I ride really close to the middle yellow line which allows cars nearly FOUR lanes; I am so generous.

OK, let's continue our little journey. Not that this street is roughly 600 feet or so:

[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="551" caption="Ward Road Overview"]<img class=" " title="Ward Road Overview" src="http://i1143.photobucket.com/albums/n631/fredollinger/ward-road-microscope.jpg" alt="Ward Road Overvie" width="551" height="256" />[/caption]

Note how shitty the road looks? This amazes me because I recently read about the Brasilia effect which means that a city could look good from an aerial photo but suck at the street level. This road sucks at every level of resolution beneath my microscope.

Here we are just before my next turn:

[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="614" caption="Right Before Rancho Mission Road"]<img class=" " title="Right Before Rancho Mission Road" src="http://i1143.photobucket.com/albums/n631/fredollinger/cimg2933.jpg" alt="Right Before Rancho Mission Road" width="614" height="461" />[/caption]

Note the problems?

The line of sight is limited. Note how cars disappear off the face of the earth as they go up the hill. These cars reappear in a few seconds and they seem to come out of nowhere. Since the area is noisy due to the nearby I-8 freeway, it's not always easy to hear for car coming. Thus, there's almost no time at all to react to cars which seem to materialize close by.

Also notice that since this is an intersection there is a lot of turning, passing, and crossing movements. Also, note that pedestrians routinely walk in front of someone without looking at all.

The funny thing is that these are the _same_ comments we hear about why cycle tracks suck. Guess what? That problem is everywhere, only way more sucky on the VC roads.

[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="614" caption="Extremely Dangerous Cross Ward"]<img class=" " title="Extremely Dangerous Cross Ward" src="http://i1143.photobucket.com/albums/n631/fredollinger/cimg2931.jpg" alt="Extremely Dangerous Cross Ward" width="614" height="461" />[/caption]

Here pedestrians and cyclists have to cross a four lane highway with no traffic lights and no stop sign. Note that this road is to code, and I have never heard a bicycle advocate complain of a liability issue.

[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="614" caption="The turn onto Rancho Mission Road"]<img class=" " title="The turn onto Rancho Mission Road" src="http://i1143.photobucket.com/albums/n631/fredollinger/cimg2929.jpg" alt="The turn onto Rancho Mission Road" width="614" height="461" />[/caption]

Again, we should note the extremely bad visibility caused in part by the bus stop, but also by the hilly landscape.

Here we have people who are coming out from Rancho Mission Road and turning onto Ward Road in both directions, people on Ward Road who want to turn onto Rancho Mission Road who are coming in two directions, and people on Ward Road who want to go straight on what they believe is a small highway.

Let's stop here and recap the "conflict points":

1. Car doors from parallel parked cars.

2. Motorists who just parked who are mindlessly walking across the 4 lane, 50 MPH street.

3. Motorists who see a 30 MPH street with some street activity but who choose to go 50 MPH because the road looks like a small highway.

4. Cyclists who have no where to go.

5. Motorists who are turning, quickly onto a blind turn.

6. Motorists who are coming out of a parking area with low visibility due to parallel parking. These motorists are encouraged to speed to stop from being hit.

I am NOT qualified in any way to give advice on making this road better. But here are my uninformed opinions:

1. Take out a lane and turn it into a two way cycle track on both sides.

2. Remove all parallel parking because it reduces visibility and encourages jay walking which is very dangerous.

3. Lower speed limit from 30 MPH to 20 MPH.

4. Move bus stop to the same side of the street as the trolley and closer to the trolley stop. This eliminates the need for transit users to jay walk and it allows them to make easier connections to and from the trolley.

5. Improve visibility for the parking lot intersection especially as it goes over the sidewalk. Perhaps we should paint the sidewalk area where cars drive on it, red to alert pedestrians to the danger of crossing movements of cars traffic. I don't know how to do this, but overall, I think that motorists should be forbidden from the sidewalk altogether.

6. Change the divider line from double yellow to dotted white. Even though that it's only a single lane, people are still going want  to pass. We should force motorists into the oncoming lane to do this. This will calm traffic as motorists won't be encouraged to change lanes without paying attention. The risk of oncoming traffic will cause motorists to be more vigilant.

7. At the intersection of Ward and Rancho Mission Road, add a signal which changes by a timer. This will discourage motorists racing to "catch a light" which will make them safer. Also pedestrians and cyclists won't have to press a button, position their bicycle in a magical place for an indeterminate time, or some other humiliating incantation to actually be allowed the awesome privilege of crossing a street.

8. The street should be flattened to reduce sight distance, but also to make it more walkable for the elderly and to make cycling more convenient.

9. Because it empties into a cul-de-sac, Rancho Mission Road only serves two legitimate purposes: access to Qualcomm Stadium and access to the nearby housing project. Thus, unless there is a game, the road should be closed to non-residents since there is no purpose for non-residents to be on this road. Most motorists who find themselves on this road become frustrated by the cul-de-sac. Merely discouraging people from going down this road will save lots of people's resources. It's like finding free time and petrol beneath the cushions in the house of traffic planning.

Not only will this be safer, but this design will save tax dollars in the long run as there will be half as much road to repair. With less cars on the road, it will be damaged less often as well.

Finally, with less traffic the people who live nearby as well as 24 Fitness enthusiasts will walk and run on this road more often. The poor car commuters and parallel parkers will gnash their teeth for a short time. Then they will find other places to get to the dentists to fix their teeth. Ultimately, you might find them taking the trolley to the area just to enjoy the peace and quiet.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I had a funny experience today.

As I stated earlier, I love, love, love riding in a car because I do it so seldom that it is still an experience of unparalleled luxury. I so love not having to think a single thought of my own safety nor to be on edge at all times in order to get from point A to point B. I just sit in a coach.

That being said, I think that there's something about driving that kills the human soul.

I know this sounds new agey and insane, but this is how I think sometimes.

If you disagree, do this experiment. Stand in the middle of a fast paced road. A good spot is the turning lane in between two double lines. As stated earlier double lines, drawn in paint on the road, create a magical barrier which can not be crossed. You just can't drive through a force field. :)

While there, try to make eye contact with everyone. You might find that people drive really close to you. If you look deep into their eyes, there will be nothing inside. There's only a dead sort anger like the light from a dying star. It's bright enough to burn you, but you can see that the passion is gone, and the flame is going out.

Anyway, that's what I see. 

These people are parents, and children, and workers, and many people love them. They love many people. They are probably enroute to volunteer in a children's hospital. But behind the wheel they are empty machines, hell bent on moving their pieces of metal as fast as they possibly can and not stopping unless they really, really have to.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I guess the main thing that changed was that before then I had been meditating regularly, and I was trying to be as happy as possible. Connecting with motorists--in my imagination--in a friendly way was one of my methods of avoiding feelings of anger and alienation.

Subsequently, I had a lot of mental and spiritual upheavals that I don't want to get into here, but I may share some of it, if people care, if I have a few beers. :)

One important part of my meditation practice is NOT to deny any feelings. On the other hand, I don't want to feel like a helpless puppet either. If I took the later approach, there would be no purpose to practice. I want to get happier here. :)

Overall, the post probably read like rewarmed ideas from a party that you attended. That's because it mostly was. When I wrote it, I was thinking of the time where someone said that she turned into a monster behind the wheel. I have also seen this happen to other people including charity workers, mediators, and all around kind and caring people.

Anyway, I'd like to discuss this further. The notion of a motorist's (and cyclist's) psychology is in its infancy. For too long we have been thought of as steel encrusted, interchangeable drops of fluid.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>I Don't Need No Edumacation</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Actually, this is funny because I am actually working on getting certified as a cycling instructor.

I know that I have bashed education before, but there was a good reason for this.

I was never anti-education for cycling. I feel that learning more is almost always better.

However, I am against invoking education as a magic spell that makes our infrastructural neglect go away.

As I said before, I am against the idea that more education is the answer for many reasons.

Also, though I like the vague idea of education, I don't think we have any good education programs now. I'd like to see something like what we have now, but I'm not sure that these current courses are the way to go.

Thus, one of the main motivations for my getting an education is to be part of the change that makes education better.

What are my problems with the current system?

Let me count the ways.

First of all, education, at this point, is really indoctrination to the VC lifestyle. This is one of the main reasons why VC people keep trying to "educate" activists.

I have noticed that "education" can even make people resistant to the facts. This is bad.

We need education which can help us to read and understand the facts of the road rather than invoking an mystical "rules of the road" or "normal traffic flow" which don't exist.

The reality of the road can only be gained by doing studies.

Overall, studies show that the roads in the US are unsafe for bicycle travel.

Also, I feel that there's a double standard when between infrastructure and classes.

For many people, infrastructure must be specifically allowed and mentioned by law or at least in legally approved design documents. In fact, I heard that the NACTO guide got dissed because it came from a "private company."

But regarding classes, there is no such high standard of approval. There is no law making a cycling safety class legal nor is there any sort of legality to the "licensing" like there is for a driver's license, for example.

But there's more.

Let's go back to our old friend, Mr. Cross.

1. In contrast to what many people say online regarding riding in a bike lane, here's a Cross quote:

"Except for accidents that resulted from the motor vehicle being out of control, it seems reasonable to assume that most Class D accidents would not have occurred if an on-street bicycle lane had been present and the bicyclist had been riding in it."

Also bike lanes prevent other types of accidents:

"It was stated earlier that on-street bicycle lanes may serve as a "buffer zone" that would serve to decrease the likelihood of some types of bicycle rideout accidents (Class A). It is also possible that the "buffer zone" provided by on-street bicycle lanes would reduce the inci­dence of accidents in which a bicyclist suddenly turns left into the path of an-overtaking motor vehicle (Problem Type 18). "

2. Another false lesson is that there are courses that can teach you to ride "anywhere'.

"With only a few exceptions, there is little that a bicyclist can be taught that would help him avoid Class D accidents once he has decided to ride where and when such accidents are most likely to occur.
"As a consequence, the primary objective of an education and training program for bicyclists should center on modifying the bicyclist's choice of where and when he will ride."

3. Here are some good tips about Class C or intersection style collisions:

"A safety-education program developed for bicyclists should teach them the typical search patterns of motorists in this type of traffic context, the limitations of the human visual system, and the types of accidents that occur because a motorist fails to observe a bicyclist that may be clearly visible. This information must be presented in a manner that will serve to modify bicyclists' assumptions that they have been or will be detected by motorists who are preparing to enter an uncontrolled roadway from a driveway or from a controlled leg of an intersection."

To me, this was totally hilarious. Basically, you are not going to be seen.

I'm not sure that teaching someone about the "human visual system" will help, though, but it is funny.

"Many bicycling experts advocate riding in the center of the traffic lane rather than along the right-hand edge of the roadway. They claim that riding in the center of the traffic lane increases the chances of
being observed by motorists who are preparing to enter the roadway from intersecting streets or driveways.

"Also, they argue that riding in the center of the lane provides a greater buffer zone between the bicycle's path and the position at which motor vehicles stop before entering the roadway. Thus, riding in the center of the traffic lane provides addi­
tional time for the bicyclist to initiate evasive action once it becomes apparent that a motor vehicle is going to enter the roadway. The authors believe that the following important questions must be answered before it is possible to recommend that bicyclists be taught to ride in the center of the traffic lane."

This is one of the biggest tenets of VCism. What does Mr. Cross say?

Here's the big reveal:

"* Would riding in the center of the traffic lane increase the likelihood of detection by a margin that has practical significance?

* Would riding in the center of the traffic lane increase the bicyclist's preview time by a margin that has practical significance?

* How would traffic efficiency be affected if riding in the center of the traffic lane became a common practice?

* Should riding in the center of the traffic lane be prohibited on some types of roadways and/or during certain time periods? If so, what types of roadways and what time periods?

* Should young bicyclists and/or slow-moving bicycles be permitted to ride in the center of the traffic lane? If not, what is the cutoff age/speed?"

These questions have NEVER been answered. In fact, VCists act as if these are NOT important considerations. Perhaps they are not, but remember, all education flows back to Mr. Cross and this landmark paper. 

Yes, there are more modern theories and papers. These too show an infrastructure mostly approach.

But it's wrong to say that people "didn't know" about this stuff. 

Read _Effective Cycling_ and _Cycle Craft_ and take a cycling safety course.

But, I urge you, if you are going to geek out on education so badly, so you can call yourself an expert, take the time to read Kenneth Cross' complete study.

You will be amazed, informed, and amused.

  <title>Green and Black Tea Party</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/02/07/green-and-black-tea-party/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Everytime I think of <a href="http://www.thegreenteaparty.com/">something clever</a> I find that it's all ready been done. 

Oh, well, here's my version of a Green and Black Tea Party.

The green is in the environment. Right wing tea baggers are willing to cut government programs which help the environment. On the other hand, why not help the environment by cutting subsidies for corporations who hurt it?

It's not that they can't harm the environment any more, but they won't get paid by Uncle Sam for the privilege.

Another way to go green tea is cut motor vehicle transportation funding. We could sell off all the freeways and thus "privatise" these things.

This can also help bring out the macho, do-it-yourselfers.

"Nobody every did anything for me in my life."

OK, I'd like to see you hire out a cement mixer and lay the freeway from your house to your job. I have been wanting to build bikeways, by my own hand for years, but I WOULD NEVER DO THAT BECAUSE IT'S ILLEGAL. NOR WOULD I EVER RECOMMEND ANYONE DO ANYTHING ILLEGAL. EVER. :)

The black is anarchy. Which is what we had in the financial system, until it came time to collect, and at this time, we had the system working as usual to take people's houses. 

Why not just not do this anymore? We could decide that repossessing houses and also enforcement of copyright is a civil matter and stop putting scary FBI warnings on movies. Everyone laughs at those, and I think that we should take law enforcement seriously. The way to do this is act more seriously. Copying a movie for a friend might be a shitty thing to do for the income of a celebrity, but it's hardly on par with defrauding people out of their houses by robo-signing. So why is one thing a federal offense and another totally unforced?

Let's just stop enforcing business law all together.

Also, we can stop with the corporate protections. We can still have corporations and charters; we need those because they make good things.

But we should stop shielding the people who buy into them from being sued because it looks like people are doing this so they can get away with hurting people with no consequence. You buy a stock and the company gets sued, well, it's your company. 

This will promote personal responsibility, one of the mantras I love best from the tea bagger movement. Before you invest in a stock, you should check things out very carefully or your house is on the line to pay for the medical bills the next time they decide to cheap things out and to server over heated coffee.

There you have it, green and black tea in your mouth at the same time!

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This is an open letter to my new friend Brendan O'Neill.

Hello, Brendan, my new friend.

You do not know me yet, but you will. I have the confidence that I can make you like me. Perhaps I am right, or perhaps, I am just <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/brendanoneill2/100134915/cyclists-are-pompous-enough-as-it-is-%E2%80%93-a-cycling-covenant-would-make-them-unbearable/">pompous.</a>

"...truckers and the other big bruisers of road travel who are apparently careless and reckless and a threat to their surroundings."

I would not say that all truckers are reckless, it would be foolish--wouldn't you agree--to say that everyone is reckless when you have not met everyone. However, I would say that if you are on a bicycle, every truck feels like a threat.

Oh, and sorry that cycling does not pollute more. I don't know why people talk about how cycling doesn't pollute as if they are missing out on extra exhaust or something.

As for the "millions spent on cycling", you did check the fact that cycling is underfunded, everywhere, didn't you. Nothing in your article about that. Nor was there anything about the vast amount of money spent on cycling is for those who are too afraid too cycle because it's bloody dangerous. The cyclists who cycle now would do so no matter what.

"Of course, if road safety can be improved to reduce the number of cycling deaths, then let’s do it (though anyone who thinks such tragedies can be wiped out entirely obviously doesn’t understand the indefeasible combination of risk and human error that will always lead to accidents)."

I liked this sentence at first, but then you made an error. You seem to think that traffic deaths are inevitable. That is totally wrong. Traffic--autos and roads--are the work of human hands. If people die, it's because people were not careful. They literally chose speed and convenience over human life. 

Sorry if that makes me pompous and smug, but I think it's wrong to let people die because we are too lazy to ride a bicycle, too cheap to build decent roads, and too thick to know the difference.

Plus, as your research would indicate, if you did any, cycling pays for itself.

The whole thing about saints and sinners in your article is mighty entertaining, but it's a bit confusing and silly, too. Lorry drivers ride bicycles. Cyclists drive trucks. So to defend cyclists is to defend lorry drivers, too. The world isn't as black and white as you make it.

You will soon find this out, when you go on a ride with me!

Yes, I invite you to join me in my smugness on your morning commute in San Diego. It should be so easy for you to live such a pompous and smug lifestyle.

I will even lend you a bicycle! I am awaiting your response when you come to ride with me, and what a huge egos us cyclists have.a

Sincerely, 

Fred]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I have said for years that you should trust a professional to do the driving.

Unforatunately, it seems that for many, when we drive too much, mindfulness is lost. Then the reptillian part of the brain takes over, and the motorist is agressive.

Thus, I have experienced motoring agression from all types on the streets of all races and all modes: agressive motorists, cyclists, and even pedestrians.

Thus, we should not demonize the mode, but rather focus on making things safer.

I felt that the article was not helpful to this discussion as it had few facts, created a strawman argument, and it attacked cyclists in exactly the same way the he claimed that truckers were attacked.

Plus, there are no truckers nor cyclists. Truckers ride bicycles, cyclists own trucks. It's not us vs. them, but making things better for all modes.

Accidents are preventable and not inevitable. Road rage and agreessive are also preventable.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Don't Lock Up the Children</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/02/11/dont-lock-up-the-children/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I saw this <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/news/teresa-339373-police-driver.html">post</a> about a girl who got hit by a car, and many of the comments were directed at the girl's parents.

What morons! The blaming bicyclists (and their parents) first (BBF) angers me so much.

I think that it's totally realistic to have a world that is relatively safe for children.

I am getting really tired of the notion that to keep children safe, we must imprison them.

Childless by choice, I usually don't think of children too much.

But since moving to the Heights, in San Diego, I noticed a LOT of children playing safely around my neighborhood, and it started me wondering where all the children are.

For example, in North Park, do you see children playing?

Finally, yesterday, I did. I rode right by it until princess pointed out that behind a giant fence, fit for a prison, children were playing.

Besides the anti-social practice of shutting down several streets in order to plonk a school there, I abhor the idea that our society is so terrible that we need to lock up our children.

I know the whole danger of sexual predators, blah, blah, blah, but I think that perhaps there's a better way.

I think about in older and wiser societies where all the adults in the community keep their eyes on the local children so that nobody hurts them.

In the skating slab where I ride my bicycle through as a peaceful shortcut from cars, there are always adults watching from afar. This is good.

What's not good is the idea that a child is only safe behind a fence. That they can't be out of sight from their parent's eyes for an instant.

I believe that children are far more intelligent than are given credit. I think that there is far less sexual predators than we are led to believe.

In fact, the biggest danger to children's lives is car accidents. This is where the kids sit INSIDE the cars. Where's the outrage for that? How come they NEVER play scary music and show automobiles? How come parents are encouraged to drive their children to school when the school bus is the safest way to get there?

This is because while fear is a useful emotion, it's not always the best way to make decisions.

We can't tell stories of a single child who got hurt while making decisions on how to make children the safest. We must look at ALL the children got hurt and HOW they got hurt.

If we are so crazy paranoid about hurting our kids, why don't we ban ALL motoring now?

If I mentioned other activities that had a fraction of the danger, we'd ban them immediately such as cycling. We'd have police officers harassing parents who let their child cycle instead of making the route safe for them to cycle.

I'll wrap up by saying that making our kids "safe" by locking them up is not free. It takes a HUGE toll. I was pretty messed up by my own parents by being denied the right to leave my lawn for years.

While the other children played outside and socialized, I was stuck inside studying. I cried a lot and I'm still sad about it.

I recall the one glorious summer, I stayed with my Aunt in Atlanta and she allowed my cousin and I to ride the metro to get to day camp. It was so liberating!

We can't deny our children the right to cycle. There are many other things that are totally killing our kids like obesity and diabetes. Jail time is not the answer. 

Let's tear down the fences around the schools and build bridges with adults who care about the children's REAL safety and not some bullshit, TSA-style facade where we continue to cart around over weight kids in big cars and then watch them die when the Escalade rolls over because mom was texting.

I feel fortunate I grew up before the nanny state became so pervasive. Despite flying over my handlebars with no helmet as a kid, I grew up without brain damage - well, at least perhaps. Hmm, perhaps brain damage would explain all my failures in life. I coulda been a contender!]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Haha, nice.

Though, I feel that I should add the phrase "nanny state" to unhelpful phrases.

I do feel that the government can put us at risk or make us safer.

For better or worse, the US govt has a powerful role in everyone's lives. Reducing the role to make us safer would put us at more risk.

I do NOT want to put people, especially children, at more risk.

My point was _how_ we make ourselves safe should be carefully, and that sometimes trying to be safer will actually put one at risk.

Your comment was helpful in forcing me to be more specific in my views, so thank-you.

I'm more evolutionary than revolutionary.]]></wp:comment_content>

I know someone who has manual windows due to that exact fear of getting stuck in his car underwater. Engineers, the guys who actually know how things work. :)

That being said, I think that we should stay away from the us vs. them approach and try to make _all_ modes safer. I see that this is happening all ready in San Diego, and I hope for more good changes to come.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Product Placement: Das Pitlock for Wheel Protection</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a response to all the problems with bicycle theft.

One of the most confounding things about bicycle theft is that while we can easily lock up our frames using a U-lock, but we can still get many of our components stolen.

One of the most common things to lose is a wheel.

When I lived in Philly, I actually carried around two U-locks so that I could lock the frame and front wheel to a post and the backwheel to the bicycle.

One of the best things about this is the peace of mind that such a simple practice gave me.

Still, however, I had trouble when my princess would ride with me. We'd try to figure out all sorts of ways to make three U-locks work. This was a huge hassle. Plus carrying two U-locks is even more of a pain in the ass than carrying one.

One easy hack to make the problem less likely is to get rid of the crazy quick release levers. I rarely failed to have the tool to take my wheel off anyway so I never saw any convenience from this. Also, this was pretty stressful as I feared getting my wheels stolen. Thus, a normal bolt is a bit better, but not great. A non-standard bolt such as a hex or even more exotic is probably all you need except for the most effective thieves.

However, finding such bolts and tools was more trouble than I expected. 

Enter <a href="http://www.pitlock.com/">PitlockTM.</a>

They make bolts and skewers especially for different makes of wheels. Thus, you can be sure that you get the proper size for your bicycle rather than having a nasty hack on your hands.

The way that it works is that there are over 200 machine made nuts which are then matched with a custom nut. You get two nuts per pack. Even better, you can order the same nuts for yourself and loved ones so that you don't need to keep duplicate tools all over the place.

The custom nut is protected by a stainless steel sheath. This has to be seen to be believed.

I have had many people tell me that this is not as effective as I thought, but I don't buy it.

One guy told me that a pipe wrench would get the nut off. False because the outer sheath does not turn at all.

Another advantage is that I can just lock up my wheel to a post if I have to. 

Pitlock costs over a hundred dollars, but I think that it's worth it. The high price discourages thieves from buying all the nuts and using them.

I am not even afraid of Pitlock becoming popular. I think that if it does, bicycle thieves would move on to something easier to steal--and more lucrative.

I am not on Pitlock's payroll, but I wish I were because I love their product so much.

I can picture the commercial now. A thief tries all kinds of tools to take off a wheel and fails each time. In the end, he takes off his black, mugger's cap and stomps on it. A German voice over says "Das Pitlock" really fast while the logo splashes on the bottom of the screen.

Oh, Pitlock, I love thee! :)]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Leaving locks is a great idea for travelling light.

However, I go all over the place.

I guess I didn't tell the story where an immigration officer threatened to cut my u-lock off a fence one time at the border when I just needed to run inside to relieve myself real quick.

I would like a u-lock which only the jaws of life will get off.

My notion is that my bike is evolving for a harsh environment. I should probably blog this more clearly...]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Cycling in the US Is Incredibly Successful and Popular</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/02/15/cycling-in-the-us-is-incredibly-successful-and-popular/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I know that with a pitiful mode share this sounds absurd, but cycling, is actually pretty successful all things considered.

Take for example, how much money is spent on motoring. I don't feel like going to google.com this morning, but it's a lot. In fact, it's pretty much all our money.

And the vast majority of people motor. Wow, isn't that a shocker? The government spends a lot of money on something and business bend over backwards to make something easy and convenient and people do it.

Plus, there are so, so many car commercials. Watch TV for an hour, on any station and count them. Then look at the number of pro-walking, transit, or cycling commercials.

So the whole idea of "we can't build for cycling because nobody does it" goes out the window, doesn't it. The proper way to say it is, despite the complete neglect of public money and in advertising, we still have around 1% mode share in US cities. For a country of 300 million, 1% is a great deal, indeed.

Let's add to that the number of movies that ridicule cycling. How many are these? Think of any movie that has cycling in it. In fact, there are so many movies that mock cyclists that to make a character look lame, goofy, and unsexy all you need to do is to show him riding a bicycle.

And women never ride bicycles except to make them look weak and vulnerable.

There are exceptions, of course, but they are rare. In many movies, motoring is seen as a short hand for a success. In many movies, the previous bicycling or public transit rider is seen driving off into the sun set in a nice fancy motor car.

And after all this abuse, and lack of funding, we STILL, STILL have 1%. I wonder how many people would drive cars if they had to pay all the costs and risk being mocked? Few could actually afford it. And very few wish to risk being a social pariah.

But there's more. Let's add the death penalty for it! True that cycling, while more dangerous than motoring, is not nearly as deadly as the public thinks. 

But thoughts are powerful.

Thus, there's the association between cycling and risk taking, death. How many times have you had a nice bicycle ride, and you were buttonholed and forced to listen to a story about someone like you who was killed for riding a bicycle.

Oh, we don't call it murder when someone is too neglectful to look out of their shiny windshield, we call it an oopsie. An accident. Someone's life is just a blip on our radar.

And we STILL have 1%.

Despite being not funded at all, ridiculed, and even made to feel like it's OK to kill us, as a joke, hee-hee, or because we "deserve" it, we STILL have 1%.

Why is that?

Mainly because cycling is awesome. 

There's no other possible explanation. Cycling is really, really fun. It's really compelling.

Not even the fear of death nor a bankrupt funding system nor all the movies in Hollywood and their billion dollar spin machine can keep us off our spin machines.

I love cycling, and I am very proud to be part of the 1%.

When I ride a bicycle, I feel very sexy, and I'm very popular. I have a real job that's successful.

I see no need to "upgrade" to a motorcycle, or anything else except, perhaps a wheelchair when I get too old.

I am very happy to cycle, and I feel like I am a normal person.

Why can't other people see this?]]></content:encoded>

I meant 1% not as shorthand for the rich or for cyclists or anything, but b/c I was too lazy (and in a hurry) to google the precise number of cyclists in San Diego.

I have all ready seen the number 1% appropriated and connected to, in a clever, but deceptive way, to suggest that the 1% of cyclists are the same 1% that are the wealthy owners of the US.

I saw this coming, but I didn't think it would happen so fast.

Oh, well nothing to be done. Just words on a computer screen...]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>What Truly Makes a Successful City?</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[http://rustwire.com/2012/02/14/an-illustrated-history-of-clevelands-varied-attempts-at-rebranding/

Having been asked this: "I don't know what Cleveland could brand itself as, actually."

Here's my response:

As a long term resident of two cities, I feel that if a city wants to "brand itself", I, as a citizen of that city are fucked.

I prefer cities to be run by people who have read Jane Jacobs and other books which tell how to make a world class city.

A city is made of things and people, but the things are made by people.

Therefore, if you have a city w/ great architecture and a great football team, but the ppl suck, the city is fucked.

If you have a city w/ great people and shitty architecture and NO football, you will soon have a great city.

The number of people, initially, it takes to transform a city is very, very small. But they have to have the freedom to act.

Most cities, IMHO, in the US at least, are run by suburban developers and other types of old money who's families ran the cities into the ground b/c they don't care to make a good city and would not know a good idea if it hit them in the face.

These ppl are the major obstacle to any positive change as are the ppl who are so stupid that they think that "branding" will make a city great.

It won't.

The only thing that makes cities great are great ppl who have a coherent vision and who apply solid design principles to the city.

And yes, that includes cycling. :)

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[http://news.discovery.com/human/humans-not-nasty-behavior-120220.html<br /><br />"De Waal showed the audience videos from laboratories revealing the dramatic emotional distress of a monkey denied a treat that another monkey received; and of a rat giving up chocolate in order to help another rat escape from a trap."<br /><br />Which raises the question, why are motorists so mean?<br /><br />Why do they view it as a hardship to give up a tiny bit of space to save some human lives? Why do so many motorists harass women? When was the last time did someone say, as a human, God damnit, I will not tolerate this abuse from my group, motorists?<br /><br />We just let the anger and hate fester. Why?<br /><br />Why are so many cycling advocates nasty?<br /><br />I have the answer!<br /><br />Or rather an answer.<br /><br />To me, it's like a 1970's sci-fi horror flick where humans are captured by aliens and forced to fight one another for their own amusement.<br /><br />If they do not select a weapon, an automobile, they will be immediately killed. If they do select a weapon, they will be forced to kill, and yet they still risk being killed, too.<br /><br />This is how are roads are designed.<br /><br />And yet when people talk about motoring, they talk about how annoying cyclists, humans who choose to be unarmed, are. They also whine about how to store their lethal weapons aka parking.<br /><br />That's it!<br /><br />The are totally and completely submissive to the aliens who laugh at our every move! "Well that's how things are, what do you expect?"<br /><br />I expect to be harassed and tortured by humans, who are by their nature kind, but now they are forced to act in an inhuman manner.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[And the victories continue to pile up in the cycling world.

It seems that if one person can mess things up for a long time, a lone person can fix things!

Let's pray that these easy victories continue!

But there's a catch to all this success, and it starts with "What's next?"

That is, once we vanquish all our enemies and uncork the dam which has held back all of our cycling money for so many years what do we do with our time.

The answer is, of course, "Ride our bicycles on the shiny new SAFE, convenient, and efficient infrastructure." 

Sure, but in between then, what?

The answer is probably that we need to be really innovative. That is the traffic engineers are going to have  a chance, finally, to innovate.

Talk to any engineer about designing new things, and her eyes will light up! Let's go crazy designing things.

Thus, in the Unbound household, we have a saying that "the best infrastructure has not yet been built."

We have not even seen it yet.

This reminds me of a great quote from the fantastic book _The Art of Choosing_.

http://www.europeanfinancialreview.com/?p=1320

A jazz player was talking about improvisation in jazz. 

He said,

“You need to have some restrictions in jazz. Anyone can improvise with no restrictions, but that’s not jazz. Jazz always has some restrictions. Otherwise it might sound like noise.” The ability to improvise, he said, comes from fundamental knowledge, and this knowledge “limits the choices you can make and will make. Knowledge is always important where there’s a choice.” The resulting action is based on informed intuition, or as he calls it, “super-thought.” In jazz, super-thought goes beyond determining the “right” answer: It allows one to see new possibilities where others see only more of the same, and to construct the rare “useful combination.”

I think that the traffic engineers know the rules, but they are too restricted, right now, by people who want them to play only folk ballads. They are not free to write the symphonies that they desire.

People are too busy, right now, worrying about the "right answer" rather than working on the more "rare useful combination."

But we will get there with my super hero kicking total ass.

We know what's in our way. 

We know how to eliminate it.

And we have all ready decided what we are going to do next!]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I feel as if I have lost a <a href="http://hembrow.eu/blog/">very good friend.</a>

The Hembrow blog was the BEST bicycle blog ever. I am not exaggerating when say this. Thus, it was a very gray day, indeed when he decided to <a href="http://www.bikebiz.com/news/read/inspirational-info-packed-bike-infrastructure-blog-is-deleted">pull the plug.</a>

Did he have a right to do this?

Yes.

Am I happy with his decision?

Not at all.

I am one of the bloggers he spoke of. I did not take any images from his blog, but I did link to him every chance I got.

I don't think that he should spend unpain hours on something that he feels is getting ripped off, but I do wish that he would decide, on his own, to put his old blog back as a reference.

Now, I have the beginnings of some brilliant ideas with dead links to hembrow.eu!

Well, what can you do, I don't feel like he reads my blog, and I do want to leave the poor person alone, but I am sad with his decision and I wish he'd reconsider.

Oh, and if he'd just package his whole blog as a book, I'd buy it and flog it on my own blog.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Jewel in the Ass </title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/02/28/jewel-in-the-ass/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[First, I'm going to link to a brilliant article which asks "What do you really want?"

http://progressivetransit.wordpress.com/2012/02/27/what-the-hell-do-you-actually-want/

I so love this because it addresses the question beyond the smaller thinking that got us into our transportation mess in the first place.

By "mess", I mean a system where people are dissatisfied in some way, and where they feel that a few small band-aids and their lives will be perfect.

For example, building a single more lane on the freeway to eliminate a bottle neck on their commute. Or in my case to build a cycle track from my job to my home.

Overall, this approach is doomed to fail because a great city is planned with all modes of transportation taken into account and a lot more factors.

This leads me to this article:

http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/opinion/slop/article_f22ad0a8-fd9e-11df-a6d6-001cc4c002e0.html

The thing I noticed occurring over and over in this article is where people called Balboa Park "San Diego's Jewel". 

While I do agree that it's quite beautiful from afar, it's scale makes me feel quite small.

Also, and I know that this won't go over well with most, but to a cyclist, the park is just a huge pain in the ass not unlike an airport.

Most parks give you paths to ride through, but Balboa Park has none. In fact, it's iconic bridge, El Prado, really sucks for cycling. Every time I ride through there, I wind up getting really pissed off because the motorists will tail gate you, buzz you, and act as total assholes just so they can break the traffic laws.

Yes, pretty much everyone who takes that bridge breaks at least one traffic law because the speed limit is 15 MPH, and I can ride faster than 15 MPH on that bridge. So why are people trying to pass me?

I don't really mind the motorists breaking the law, I try to mind my own business, but they really annoy me. Also, I really hate the hypocritical whining about "scofflaw cyclists." If you want to see the other end of that stick, ride your bike on El Prado.

So what do I want?

I'd really like to see some cycling freeways which cut through some obvious places like Balboa Park. Then maybe it will be a jewel and not some massive road block that puts me out of my way each time I'd like to ride cross town that way.

If we can drop an entire freeway through a park as well as paving enough of it over to do Walmart proud, while still painting the whole thing green on tourist maps, a few dedicated cycling paths will not further mar the "Jewel's" good looks.

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Yes.

However, Balboa Park is pretty paved over as it is. From the post, I said that a freeway goes through the park and the parking rivals Walmart. That's a lot of paving.

So to say "if we simply pave over" implies that the park is not paved over.

That is not true.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Cycling and the Sexes</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I am reading an excellent book called _The Gender Delusion_ about how our modern "science" is continuing sex based stereotypes based on shitty research models.

People! Graphs and stats don't prove anything if your experimental setup is biased. 

How many ways can you lie with science?

<a href="http://www.lavidalocavore.org/diary/5107/wanted-scientific-integrity-on-gmos">Many ways!</a>

I know the food blog has nothing to do with this post except that this is one of my favorite blog entries of all times.

There are other ways of fooling ourselves while pretending to be objective.

One is a moving set of "standards".

I have noticed that this is true with my old friends, the VCers arguments.

So this is true all over the place.

In _Delusions of Gender_, they talk about how interviewers, when given identical resumes would pick the one with more education when the male resume had more education. When the female had more education, they would pick the male anyway due to his "real world experience".

Thus, no matter what, a man gets picked, and we stick to objective "standards".

We can apply this to cycling advocacy.

In advocacy, if someone brings up stadards, we need to make sure that they make sense. For me, the only three standards for government bicycle policy are safety, efficiency (for motorists AND cyclists), and comfort (for cyclists).

Also, if the standards are abstract and can't be seen, touched, tasted, smelled, or heard, then beware. And if you can't boil it down for a nine year old, beware.

While thinking of one's sex, and cycling, I was thinking of the old chestnut, "why don't more women ride in the US."

Based on my prior post on safety, I actually think that the question should be, "Why do men ride at all?"

That's not a sign of health for cycling.

But things are getting better! I can feel it happening...]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Sidewalk Riding Redux</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/02/29/sidewalk-riding-redux/</link>

  <guid isPermaLink="false">http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/?p=1185</guid>
  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1024" caption="Take the (bike) lane!!"]<img alt="Take the (bike) lane!!" src="http://i1143.photobucket.com/albums/n631/fredollinger/CIMG2981.jpg" title="Take the (bike) lane!!" width="1024" height="768" />[/caption]

I found I have been doing a lot more sidewalk riding lately.

The main reason is stress.

In accordance with popular belief, riding with traffic, even in a shoulder is stressful especially when you see above where there is a blind curve.

Note how if I had been "taking the lane", I'd be just another statistics. Shit, this truck didn't even give any space to the bike lane. I guess he thought he was in a bicycle?

Anyway, at this point, there's nobody on the sidewalk. In fact, I'm highly confused as to why there's a sidewalk here at all. But whatever, I'm riding on it daily now.

I also ride on it by the school which is right in front of my house. This is because motorists who are driving though the school zone are totally distracted. It's a wonder that they don't run down a child (perhaps their own) due to their really shitty driving.

Yes, there are those motorists who do yield and yield. That's great; let's protect the kids. But who speeds through a school zone?

We need to step up the child molester people pressure on these people because they literally kill more people than child rapists. Why isn't this frowned upon more?

Child murders were 978 (under 16 years old) in 2008:

http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/law_enforcement_courts_prisons/crimes_and_crime_rates.html

While there were 1,045 (under 13 years old) in 2008 who were pointlessly killed in motor vehicle accidents:

http://www.iihs.org/research/fatality_facts_2008/children.html

Oh, I follow a few rules while riding on the sidewalk?

1. Stop at every driveway and intersection and LOOK.

2. Dismount whenever there's a pedestrian and until I can pass. Give her lots of room and don't expect a thanks. Pedestrians belong on the sidewalk, and they deserve respect and the right of way.

Overall, I'm now, proudly, a sidewalk cyclist, and I feel much, much safer and less stressed for it.]]></content:encoded>

If it helps, there's NO sidewalk "with the traffic" in my commute so this is impossible.

Also, I don't know why I need to ride slowly.

As I stated in my blog post, I come to a complete stop at every single intersection.

I peer around each bush and corner and make eye contact w/ each driver. If there is a driver, I yield and wave her through.

I really can't see how this is dangerous at all. I really for the life of me can't see why people feel this is dangerous...but they do. A lot.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Every motorist is trained to "look left, then look right, look left one last time and then pull out." The wrong-way sidewalk cyclist runs afoul of this training, especially as speed increases. That risk is not only at intersections, but also at every driveway. If you read my blog regularly, you would find that even the Colleyville PD noticed that sidewalk cyclists were getting hit OUT OF ALL PROPORTION.

And it is a situation I have almost hit people on bikes myself many times - even on my bike.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[A very simple compromise concerning sidewalk safety would be to permit anyone to use the sidewalk, but to have a general sidewalk speed limit of approximately 5 km/hr, which is the speed at which people walk. I say "approximately" intentionally, because this is not a well-defined speed, and I would not want there to be signs every block and overly aggressive enforcement! 

The point is that a variety of user would be permitted to use the sidewalk (roller bladers, skate boarders, and even runners can be a menace on sidewalks too!), but on condition that they are not threatening pedestrians.  And how to know if someone is breaking the "speed limit"? Common sense: if there are pedestrians in the area and someone is traveling significantly faster than the pedestrians are walking, then they are going too fast! And if there is no one around to be bothered, then it does not really matter....]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'm so glad you addressed the legal issue. Whether or not it's legal or not depends on the local govt. However, in all the cities where I ride on the sidewalk (daily for years, too!) I have NEVER heard of anyone getting any flack from the police.

Why is this? They don't care about what happens on the sidewalks. Right or wrong, this is a fact.

See there are written laws and there are enforced laws.

Written laws are meaningless. Something might be illegal on the books, but that's a totally meaningless notion if the police don't actually enforce that law.

This is one of many reasons why I endorse sidewalk riding until we get cycle tracks which is soon I hope.

Also, in my blog post I all ready said that when I see a pedestrian I DISMOUNT AND WALK MY BICYCLE UNTIL I PASS THEM (emphasis mine).

I'm starting to get sad because I am suspecting people are commenting based on the title of my posts without reading the content.

Don't make me sad.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I look left and right again. However, motorists do NOT look at all. This is a fact. They especially do not look in front of them which makes being in their path be it in an intersection, a travel lane or even a sidewalk near a parking garage potentially deadly.

I almost got hit while riding on sidewalk today. I did not. Why?

Because I LOOKED. This was in the original post, and I'd appreciate it if you'd read it and understand it rather than getting me to repost portions of it over and over again.

BTW, I had WAY more near missing while in the middle of a travel lane than anywhere else. Also, ~= 50% of cyclists ride on the sidewalk, but &lt; 20% of fatalities are to sidewalk riders. This is b/c sidewalk collisions, when they happen are less fatal.

Thank-you.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[More on the Sidewalk Back and Forth

"50% of people ride on sidewalks? Where does that come from?"

I made it up just as VC people make shit up all the time, I can too. 

From my experience, half the cyclists I see are on the sidewalk. If you have a better source, please send it along.

Otherwise, don't agree without any evidence; it wastes my time.

Absence of evidence does not mean evidence of absence. Duh!

"As for the sidewalk riding post versus comments, it illustrates how interpreting something in light of one’s own experience can override what a blogger actually wrote. Around my parts, typically, a sidewalk has a driveway or intersection an average of every 50 feet and stopping at each and every one of those would be slower than walking. As a result, I FAILED to register your situation with long sidewalk runs with no intersections or pedestrians and so I apologize."

It's OK. You are a big person for apologizing and my respect for you went WAY UP.

I'm highly intelligent. Riding on a sidewalk or door zone which is dangerous is stupid. Since I'm not stupid, in the future, you can assume I won't do anything stupid. I assume others to use their own common sense, too.

"However, your assertion that “motorists do not look at all” is not supported by any evidence I have ever seen and I think it is a dehumanizing stereotype."

You are right. They may look. I don't really know.

I do feel that it is safer for me to assume that I am not seen. All my accidents and near misses started with the assumption that "they will stop". Since then, I have stopped assuming that I will be seen.

I didn't mean this as a character attack on motorists and none will be offended. Motorists are far nastier to each other than I am to them so don't worry about the poor motorists's delicate sensibilities. If they want to really have thin skin they can check out cycling. :)

"In my experience, the overwhelming majority of motorists are both careful and considerate and I am CERTAIN my kids are that way. If that were not true, I could not have ridden the last 15000 miles without a single close call. Yes, my commute cycling log turned past 15000 miles earlier this week."

I have ZERO concern for considerate motorists. Have you seen the Chris Rock's Civil War rant?

"I'm a considerate motorist."

That's what yer supposed to do you low-expectation having MF.

If only 0.000001% of motorists do NOT see me, I'm dead.

I don't know why this is such a hard thing to grasp.

Last commute, I almost got hit 2x!]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Recall our new friend, <a href="http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/02/08/cycling-smugness/">Brendan O'Neill,</a> who wrote a screed about how cyclists were so smug and a threat to becoming "unbearable"?

"In the spirit of friendship, I accept your offer to join you on your commute in San Diego. I will finally stand up and be a man and admit I will wrong. Also, I will stop cowering inside of automobiles while I writing about the feelings of other people as if I know what I'm talking about. I'm sorry that I said anything bad about cyclists as I don't really do it so how the hell would I know? Please accept my apology and allow me to join you on your ride if you offer is still open." :)

Just kidding. He didn't write back at all.

But I still have been thinking of this notion of calling cyclists "smug" and how it is a really clever manipulation.

It's clever because it robs a cyclist of any kind of response. Now that the cyclist is "smug" we don't hear a human talking, we hear a "smug asshole".

This is the same kind of dehumanization that allowed otherwise good people to keep slaves and to work for the Nazis.

To dehumanize someone is to totally cut ourselves off from them. This is one of the reasons I despise the whole notion of looking at people as "motorists" as well. We are all human beings, and it's unwise to think otherwise.

Dehumanization is also awesome because it allows one to win an argument when all the facts are against someone. In fact, when I see this kind of trick being pulled, I immediately stop listening to the speaker. Next, I assume that the speaker is trying to hide something and I look for it.

Usually it's a whole bunch of facts. Here are some facts that bother Brendan:

1. Cycling is really good for you. It's one of the best forms of excercise and those who cycle all their lives look much younger than their age with no surgery.

2. Cycling is the closest thing we have to a cure from childhood obesity AND to childhood type II diabetes. We're wasting millions researching "the cure" for these problems, but if we spent this money on infrastructure, the drug company people would be poorer. But obesity and diabetes II rates would fall fast.

3. Cycling is super fun.

4. Cycling scales better than motoring. The notion of motoring for everyone is absurd and self defeating. Imagine competing for gasoline with 2 billion more people. Imagine sitting in traffic behind big trucks instead of whizzing by a few bicycles.

Motoring is one of those things where people can't make up their mind. If it's so great, why bitch about "traffic"? "Traffic" is merely a shit load of people motoring. And motoring is awesome right? Can't have it both ways.

5. Cycling cuts down on congestion and petrol prices. If enough people do it. But instead we should drive those up by slandering cycling. Right? :)

So cycling is super awesome and the only argument that people have against it is to call cyclists names. Really mature.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Cycling Elevator Speech</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Cycling Elevator Speech

What do cyclist really want, in a nutshell?

First of all, why do I cycle?

"So I don't have to kill a kid."

That's as short as I can get. To unpack, it means that as a careful cyclist, I feel that I want to get around in a way where there's zero chance that I will kill a child.

I realized this early on after driving, when I got into a minor fender bender. It was such a tiny mistake, but it caused me so much grief. The only thought that kept going through my mind is "what if this had been worse?" How would I have lived with myself.

Having lived in a town which was totally walkable, I realized that motoring was mainly necessary only because other people choose to motor which creates a need for wider streets and huge parking lots which in turn makes walking less practical which in turn creates more motorists which continues to feed itself until there are no walkers left.

So basically, I cycle because I don't want to kill a kid, and things are too far away to walk to.

So one way of getting rid of cyclists is removing parking and making stuff closer together again so I can walk everywhere. Until then, you have to put up with us.

Secondly, what do cyclists want?

Efficiency (everyone even motorists), safety (everyone), and comfort (peds and cyclists, only).

Efficiency does not mean more parking or driving faster. It means that things are closer to motorists than before. This often means removing parking and narrowing streets which is NOT what most motorists mean by efficiency. Perhaps I should say accessibility.

Safety is self-evident and should come from the built environment, only. 

Comfort means that a person is as comfortable walking or cycling as she is in a car. This means the SAME amount of noise as one hears in a car. Also, a mom should feel safe enough to let her child cycle. If you don't think that you should "take the lane" on a tricycle, then it's nonsense to say that this is a "cycle route".

So here's the nutshell again: "Not to kill a kid, but to have efficiency, comfort and safety."]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Foggy Notion</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Here's me going back and forth with a commenter. I LOVE it!!

“You present the false notion–aided by not providing a working definition of VC for the purposes of your rebuttal of it–that VC and infrastructure are mutually exclusive.”

Um, please go read _Effective Cycling_. Or read this evidence here: google.com. There you’ll find plenty of evidence that shows that the VC crowd has fought infrastructure.

For now, VC and education are pretty much the same. Again, do your research. They even call it “riding vehicularly.” I am trying to put together a non-VC class and to get it approved by the government. It will teach how to ride in bike lanes and on the sidewalk. Want to help me?

Haha, alienating readers. I don’t care about this.

I am here to write things that people are too afraid to say. I am here to look at all the information and give my best opinion…with jokes.

If you want to “not be alienated” please don’t read this blog. Thanks, though, for helping me make a disclaimer.

By saying that “nobody rides VC”, I mean to say that I NEVER see people perfectly executing the moves that our outlined in _Effective Cycling_. I am trying to find them because I think that they exist. Mostly the spandex racers are on the shoulder or on the OB bicycle PATH.

And a peleton does NOT count. Anyone can be brave with 20 of their friends.

“Yes, let’s continue to divide the cycling community.”

The bicycle community has been divided for 30 years. There were less than 1% of us who spoke for pro-VC views to the govt. Then there was the 99% plus who wanted to ride but were too scared and we thought (wrongly) that the govt wanted us not to ride. This is another VC lie.

When I am defensive “Forrester had good ideas for the time” this will be abused by VC people. Instead, we need to take the fight home and destroy their base, forever. Only then will we get infrastructure. Or you can live for “peace at any price” and let them to continue to run the terms of debate. My mind is made up on what needs to be done.

BTW, does anyone read this blog? No. Does it determine public policy? No. This is for me and my friends to cache my stats and to tell some jokes.

“It is ridiculous to suggest that everyone who practices or promotes vehicular cycling in any circumstance (or by grouping and labeling these people “VC” in the first place) is suggesting it’s the only way to ride in any circumstance.”

Which is why I never said that.

“I ride VC, and it works very well for me.”

For the love of God, please STOP SAYING THAT. You have no idea how damaging that is to cycling in the US. Please read some more and wake up!

“When I learned to drive a car, I applied the same principles I use when riding a bike, and they are quite transferable.”

No they are not. I’m not going to itemize the differences but they are enough so that the law in all 50 states does not equate the two. In fact, trucks and cars differ legally, too. Only VC brainwashing could force me to make such obvious statements to someone over 5 years old.

“Yes, it would be nice if every bike route were safe, but the fact is they aren’t all.”

Yes, and I personally blame the VC nuts for this. ONLY.

“Similarly, just because a “VC” person opposes a piece of infrastructure it doesn mean they’re opposed to all infrastructure.”

Yes, they are. This is another lie they tell. Trust me, they will pretend to be for it get on a committee and stab us in the back. I saw this happen, for real, many, many times before I came to the conclusions I came to.

“I know a number of “anti-VC” people who would nonetheless support it because lanes that make things more dangerous because hey, infrastructure dedicated to cycling must make cycing safer, right?”

Wrong. Nobody supports making things more dangerous except for those who want to dedicate all the money to motoring, only. If you hadn’t noticed they just passed a bill which would make that much easier on the federal level. Please wake up.

“I look forward to seeing how you misinterpret and spin my comments to demonstrate how I want all cyclists to die, or that because I support cycling intrastructure I’m therefore defined out of the VC category.”

I will not do that. This is called “mind reading” and it’s a sign of distorted thinking. If you’d read all my posts, you’d see how I talk about this.

It’s impossible to tell what people want, inside their heads. I would like to talk about what decisions, in the real world, I actually saw. Plus jokes! :) ]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[More and more, you are hearing whining from the Quisling choir that those of us who want the other 99% to ride bicycles are "dividing the community".

That's good because it shows that the realists in the cycling community are starting to have a positive impact.

But why are we so against, "finding common ground with the pro-education, VC point of view?"

This is because the VCers killed the middle ground.

I'll say this again, THE VC COMMUNITY VOTED AGAINST THE MIDDLE GROUND.

If you understand this simple fact, you can stop reading now.

For those of you who are new here, you must realize that for over 30 years, bicycle advocates have struggled to get more infrastructure and to educate our members of the cycling community.

For these efforts, we have been stabbed in the back again, and again and again.

What does this mean? Look at the bicycle box issue, which raised my consciousness to the fact that the Quislings do not speak for me at the state and national level. Before this issue, I did not realize that there were those who were so insanely against infrastructure that they'd speak out against DATA COLLECTION.

Sorry for the all caps, but I have gotten some really thick commenters lately who seem to scan the articles so I want these key points to be gleaned by all but the most myopic reader.

VC QUISLINGS WORK AGAINST DATA COLLECTION REGARDING THE SAFETY OF INFRASTRUCTURE.

Then they turn around and say we can't have infrastructure because we don't know that it's safe or not. Then they advocate for useless classes that nobody wants to take and even less people want to teach. By the way, teaching classes is almost at the level of "individual advocacy" which is almost a total waste of time because there's too many people to educate. How the hell am I supposed to get 2 million San Diegan's on board 20 or so at a time? These are the ones who I first have to convince to give me money and a weekend. 

Also, let's look at what "dividing the community" will really do.

We have less than 1% of cyclists who ride VC. We have a minimal number of people who ride bicycles at all. Then we have tons of people who are not even allowed to decide NOT to ride because it's not a choice on their radar. That's right, to decide NOT to do something, you have to feel like you have a choice to do it. Most people I speak with have all ready decided that cycling in San Diego is too insane to do.

Now if you are in any kind of society and 99% of the people decide what you do is insane, it's insane. Period.

However, everyone I spoke with--from the weekend mountain biker to the suburban mom who has no plans to cycle ever--thinks that making it safer to cycle in San Diego is a good idea. They think that the best way to do this is to build stuff to make it safer. This view dove tails with all the successful cycling cities in the world and is in agreement with standard engineering practice in the cycling world.

So why don't we have it?

By now, the astute reader knows.

But get this. Every person I tell about the whole VC nonsense IS AUTOMATICALLY ON MY SIDE!

That' right, by speaking about our divisions in the cycling community, I am not dividing the community I AM RECRUITING NON-VC VOTERS.

And this is the _real_ reason that the VC people, only, whine about "dividing the community".

They have cloaked themselves a few years ago and operated in the darkness.

They have told one group one thing, "I'm for _some_ kinds of infrastructure." Then they turn around and tell the engineers something totally different, "The cycling community is against infrastructure."

If you don't believe me then go to meetings, get on local planning boards and speak up in favor of infrastructure.

Watch who has problems with "liability issues", "safety issues", "engineering issues", "enforcement issues", and those who want to continually make minor tweaks on everything until the funding period is over and the money goes to another community or towards motoring. 

These people are not your friends; they are not any cyclists friends.

So let's get the word out and divide the community as quickly as possible. We'll take the 99% and they can have their pathetic 1%.*

===================================================

* Note by "1%" this is merely rhetorical. This should be obvious since "1%" is a very round number and thus should not be taken literally.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Though there's a lot of money to be made in cycling, including by construction in building cycling infrastructure that we so badly need in the US, many companies openly disrespect cyclists.

So much for the "customer always being right." I'm more for, "the customer not being treated like a bitch...unless he deserves it." :)

<a href="http://www.americanasphalt.com/">American Asphalt</a>* is not one of those companies.

Recently, they did some work near the Qualcomm Bicycle Path. What they were doing is still a mystery to me, but it does look an awful lot like making a huge mountain out of sand.

However, they did this right. They were careful to keep trucks from the entrance of the Bicycle Path. They swept up excess sand to keep from having a slip and fall hazard, and they did not buzz cyclists, but rather gave us our own lane.

Their workers were professional, too, allowing us cyclist to stay out of their way so that they could preform their important jobs--whatever that is.

If you are going to build a cycle track, I'd give American Asphalt a chance to work on it.

=================================================================

* Note, I am NOT being sponsored by American Asphalt, but I am open to taking money from almost anyone. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Not Reaching the Choir</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/03/09/not-reaching-the-choir/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[It must be two years ago, where I was asked to give some local bicycle advocates some ideas regarding their goals for the next year.

My ideas were mostly laughed at.

I'm not naming names, but somebody started go down my list and implement every last one of those ideas.

They are working great now! The funny thing is that the naysayers are not only claiming credit, but also that they had implemented some of the ideas in the past!

OK then.

Flash forward to now. I have thought and thought about how I could have done things different. Mainly my answer is to go to the tweed ride and skip the meeting all together.

This morning, however, I had another idea.

To explain it, I'll have to give you some insight to the Unbound morning. Typically I chat with Princess for a while regarding the state of cycling.

One thing we don't talk about are things like, "Hey have you read this amazing book called _Traffic_?" because we know we both have.

This is known as "preaching to the choir" in our house hold.

But then I realized that there's a choir that actually is NOT getting preached to!

Or rather the choir isn't singing! :)

That's right, now how many bicycle advocates do you know? And how many drive all over the place? And why is that? Also, note there is a strong correlation with a cyclist's VCness with their lack of actual cycling. This is because VC cycling sucks all the fun out of cycling which is why Mr. Forrester himself does not cycle at all and has not for years.

But he's quick to tell others how to cycle and when they were wrong despite the changing conditions of the world and his total lack of current real world experience. It's like someone starting a religion where people who don't know how to have sex tell you not to wear a condom. Oh wait! :)

Anyway, back to my choir analogy, imagine going to church and most of the singers are sitting in the pews NOT singing. There are only a few singers, and oh what stars they are. But the ones in the pews keep talking about "vehicular singing" and how awesome it is.

But their voices are sucky from no practice. The loudest (talker) of them all NEVER sings and he can't even carry a tune! But he keeps telling us all to sing and to sing his way, as if we were a car singing.

Yes, this makes zero sense, but that's how the choir at this church rolls. They can't even sit still in an analogy!

So flashing back to that fateful meeting that made me miss the tweed ride. If I were there now, I'd ask everyone a single question, "of those who chose to drive here, why did you do that?"

And THIS, my friends, would be the list of things that they should work on for the next year. Whatever reason they feel that THEY, as advocates, can't ride, they should fix.

If it's too far, get a train that will fill the gap which is so fast that driving would feel glacial. If it's because of their kids, we need to get their damned kids on bikes. And so on. 

Because if we can't even advocate to the fuckin' choir then get out of the church!

Oh, and new rule. Those of you who comment on here should be car free for a month before commenting. If not then you have no right to tell me how to ride my bicycle anymore than someone who can't sing tells Pavarotti that his middle C is a bit off.

You know who you are.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Cycling and Harmlessness</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/03/13/cycling-and-harmlessness/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This probably going to sound arrogant, but one of the main reasons that I continue to cycle is harmlessness.

This is, I feel like it has a good balance between convenience for me, and less harm for others.

The reason I mention this is because two things have been frustrating my ride lately and making me want to buy the longest, hugest, most gas guzzling truck ever. The first was because I'm getting really tired of getting harassed by motorists. After doing my experiments with holding out my bicycle lock, I realize that ALL motorists who have buzzed me did this on purpose.

This is a quite cruel thing to do, and it was making me really despise everyone who owned and operated a motor vehicle ever because they belonged to that group which treats other humans badly. Also, the VC morons really exhausted me mentally and just gave me a disgusting taste in my mouth regarding cycling in general.

I think that VC cyclists have hurt a lot of people throughout the years, but especially themselves. They may not be dead, but they are totally dead to cycling because they don't ever ride except as some kind of exibition event with large signs proclaiming how awesome they are for riding. 

Real cyclists don't talk any more about it than motorists talk about NASCAR and motoring in general.

As I stated earlier, sidewalk riding saved me I am continuing to cycle and salmon more places and enjoy every second of it. I feel like a child again. It is SO, SO, SO much more relaxing and safer than riding in the street. Don't belive the hype.

One of my visions for the future--don't know how to get there--is for cycling to be more normal than motoring. 

That is, you know the funny stares you get when you tell people you got someplace without a car (after they ask about your car, I never volunteer this)? I want motorists to have that. I want people to look at them really funny and ask them where their NASCAR costume is.

This isn't because I want to humilate people, though this can be fun. :)

Rather, I feel that if cycling were that easy, there would be a large benefit to people.

I believe this can happen. It has elsewhere, and it's starting to here.

  <title>More on the Sidewalk Back and Forth</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/03/12/more-on-the-sidewalk-back-and-forth/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Here's some more static on what I thought was pretty simple and logical to the point of being silly and pendantic. Only in the cycling world does the simple get to become so twisted and complex.

"50% of people ride on sidewalks? Where does that come from?"

I made it up just as VC people make shit up all the time, I can too. 50% is a very round number. I probably should have said 51.0765%. :)

From my experience, half the cyclists I see are on the sidewalk. If you have a better source, please send it along.

Otherwise, don't agree without any evidence; it wastes my time.

Absence of evidence does not mean evidence of absence. Duh!

"As for the sidewalk riding post versus comments, it illustrates how interpreting something in light of one’s own experience can override what a blogger actually wrote. Around my parts, typically, a sidewalk has a driveway or intersection an average of every 50 feet and stopping at each and every one of those would be slower than walking. As a result, I FAILED to register your situation with long sidewalk runs with no intersections or pedestrians and so I apologize."

It's OK. You are a big person for apologizing and my respect for you went WAY UP.

I'm highly intelligent. Riding on a sidewalk or door zone which is dangerous is stupid. Since I'm not stupid, in the future, you can assume I won't do anything stupid. I assume others to use their own common sense, too.

"However, your assertion that “motorists do not look at all” is not supported by any evidence I have ever seen and I think it is a dehumanizing stereotype."

You are right. They may look. I don't really know.

I do feel that it is safer for me to assume that I am not seen. All my accidents and near misses started with the assumption that "they will stop". Since then, I have stopped assuming that I will be seen.

I didn't mean this as a character attack on motorists and none will be offended. Motorists are far nastier to each other than I am to them so don't worry about the poor motorists's delicate sensibilities. If they want to really have thin skin they can check out cycling. :)

"In my experience, the overwhelming majority of motorists are both careful and considerate and I am CERTAIN my kids are that way. If that were not true, I could not have ridden the last 15000 miles without a single close call. Yes, my commute cycling log turned past 15000 miles earlier this week."

I have ZERO concern for considerate motorists. Have you seen the Chris Rock's Civil War rant?

"I'm a considerate motorist."

That's what yer supposed to do you low-expectation having MF.

If only 0.000001% of motorists do NOT see me, I'm dead.

I don't know why this is such a hard thing to grasp.

Last commute, I almost got hit 2x!]]></content:encoded>

  <title>I Follow All Traffic Laws</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/03/14/i-follow-all-traffic-laws/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a response to those people who say that they have never seen a cyclist follow a traffic law ever.

Guess what? I follow all the traffic laws.

I only mean to put this out there for all the peope who say that they have never seen it. Now you have seen it.

Oh, you haven't seen it with your own eyes? Take a ride with me. You will see me not only stopping at every stop sign, but also yielding to motorists when I don't legally need to. This gets motorists to run even more stop signs. I can even get many motorists to break traffic laws with a wave of my hand. 

See, even if I voluntarily yield, that does not take away a motorists legal obligation to stop at a stop sign. Yet, when I stop, when I don't have a stop sign, the motorist breaks the law. No, I don't hold it against them, but if you don't believe me, come ride, and you, too, will enjoy the thrills of inducing motorists to break the law. 

In the meantime, please stop talking about this becauses you know it's not true.

Also, I'd like to note that I resent being put into a group known as cyclists because it's unfair to motorists.

Why?

Because groups are defined by what they are not. And if I have to be bundled into a group of people who run stop signs and injure older pedestrians, motorists have to OWN THEIR SHIT.

Motorists kill far too many people. I resent the my good friends being grouped in with all those killers. I, too, am a motorist, so this is totally unfair.

So when someone says, "all you cyclists run stop signs", it puts the image in my head of the speaker being a serial killer. 

So if you want me to think you are a spooky serial killer, keep whining about cyclists as if we are part of some borg like group think rather than individuals all with differing hopes and dreams.

Oh, and while we are on the topic, I _do_ appreciatoue the notion that motorists are starting to worry about following traffic laws and traffic safety. Because some motorists do follow all the traffic laws, I just notice the many, many outliers.

But, as I said above, I don't really care about motorists breaking laws. I mainly care about them getting hurt. So if they run a stop sign because they checked and it's safe, I don't care. I do worry when they do things to put themselves and others _regardless of what the actual law it_. That's right, I care about real safety and not the whole song and dance about minimal legal complicance. That's kid's stuff.

To truly have compassion is to focus on the needs of others. 

Yes, my compassion sucks, but I'm at least working on it one bicycle ride at a time.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This was a post I was supposed to write yesterday, but as always the blather overwhelms the blog post seed, and I wind up with more than one post. And I keep thinking I'll be out of ideas because I'm just repeating myself over and over again. Whatever.

Jesus once said, "Hypocrite! First get rid of the log in your own eye; then you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend's eye." Matthew 7:5 http://bible.cc/matthew/7-5.htm

This is how I feel about motorist's whining about cyclists.

Not because we aren't a pain in the ass. A few of us feel that "controlling motorists" and clogging up an otherwise fast moving lane with grandma--I ain't no road warriah!--going at 5 MPH is the "safe and comfortable" way to be.

Though I am not one of them, I do have to say that these people are actively trying to make cyclists better.

Though I don't agree with all their ideas, I'd be a small man indeed not to admit that groups like http://cyclingsavvy.org/ are actively trying to teach cyclists to follow traffic laws.

Since there are at least 100X more motorists than cyclists (and many of us cyclists are motorists), I feel that there would be at least a few people who actively tried to teach motorists to drive safer.

There are none.

Sure there are driver's ed classes which teach children how to drive. That's NOT what I'm talking about.

What about a class which says, you all ready know how to drive, let's have you drive safer.

Not a one.

Sure there are required classes for repeat offender motorists who have broken traffic laws. That's required.

I'm talking about VOLUNTARY MOTORING SAFETY CLASSES. Those which try to get 100% of motorists to comply with all traffic laws.

MADD is the best that we have which only addresses about 50% of the biggest causes of motoring fatalities. The other 50% is speeding which people brag about.

What other stupid, and dangerous crimes do people brag about? Not many. 

Drinking and driving used to be macho before MADD. Now these potential killers are shunned. What about MAS (Mothers Against Speeding)?

Why doesn't MADD want to get deeper into the underlying causes of vehicular deaths such as poor urban design such as bars with parking lots which practivally beg people to drink and drive? No, instead MADD is going down the anti-drinking route which is a gray world indeed.

How about a world with lots of happy and safe drunk cyclists? Why do we live in third world infrastructure which causes so many deaths unlike the First World which is starting to address silly problems like drunks running into poles?

Ug, I got off track again, here's the point.

Cyclists are addressing their problems. There are cyclists that yell at cyclists to follow laws. There are motorists who yell at cyclists to follow laws. There are motorists who yell at cyclists to break laws "ride on the sidewalk".

It's illegal, duh! Cyclists have been yelled at far too much. There's no sense of proportion, the world is out of wack!

Where are the motorists who voluntarily chase down speeders and yell at them? Why are not motorists shaming one another at killing so many kids?

A few years ago, we had a stupid "Lose the Roaditude" campaign which said, among other things, for cyclists to ride legally. This was paid for by cyclists.

Where's the "safe motoring PSAs". I NEVER saw a sign that says, don't run stop signs, don't harass cyclists, don't speed. I'm sure they exist.

I feel like a bird watcher trying to track down a rare breed, a motorist who cares more about their own safety record than they do about harmless infractions by cyclists.

So here's what I want. Let the cyclists take care of their own communities and stop pestering pedestrians, delaying motorists (get out of the road, idiot!), and to stop running stop signs.

You, motorists, can stop killing and maiming people. I won't tell motorists how to drive if motorists don't tell me how to ride by bicycle.

On the other hand, if someone wants to get their ass out onto the road to _show_ me how to ride, I'm game.

My commute is lonely, and I want someone to ride with. :) ]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I loved your comment especially the part about mutual understanding. That's what I want, too!

I'll try to elaborate a bit more on what the point of this post was:

There are driver tests in the US. There are no bicycle license tests. But there are extra classes a cyclist can take for safety. The latter classes were made by cyclists. The point of my post was that motorists whine about how dangerous and stupid cyclists are, but there is a voluntary class to take to be a good cyclist which basically tell you how to deal with cars as they are VC style, ride with traffic. 

However, there are no motoring classes that teach a motorist how to drive safer, meaning over and above the law. That was the point of my article.

That it's hypocritical to whine about bad cyclists while not making a similar class to fix one's one bigger problems.

Then I started thinking about what I wanted this class to teach and there was the post. Perhaps it should have been laid out a bit better.]]></wp:comment_content>

Understanding the perspective from the other point of view is crucial for fostering mutual understanding....]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thank-you. I was aware that race car drivers were teaching driving courses, but I did not know that they were teaching them for normal drivers to be "safer".

I was hoping for a class which would teach people to drive in a slower and more relaxed manner, but I the article speaks of the high stakes "crash avoidance" that I'm sure I'm rubbish at. I'd prefer to drive slow and not to worry about "crash avoidance" or anything of the sort. If there's a potential crash, I'll probably die like many other people.

To me, the answer is for me to take it slow and to stay off the road. When I do, I feel happy and calm.

Fatal accidents happen only once but to be calm and happy daily is possible. 

John Allen is the same guy who exaggerates the dangers of door zone because of his religious belief--with no basis in any stats that I have looked at nor any he has on his own webpage--in the dangers of separated infrastructure.

He's has used the death of someone, in a rare case, to argue against bike lanes.

I wonder if he's going to use this class to argue against any kind of infrastructure for motoring. That would be crazy, but no more insane than the stuff he says about cycling now.

I wonder if he thinks that taking a single driving safety course gives him the ability to evaluate, on a piece of paper, every type of motoring infrastructure. This would be analogous to how our local VC nuts towards cycling infrastructure. Read a book, take a course, and you are an expert.

I'd prefer to have an expert build infrastructure for me, but we seem to have legislated any kind of real cycling safety improvements out of existence. Here in California is does not matter how dangerous it is; if it's to code, it gets built.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So many readers have whined at me as if I were some kind of Oprah of the cycling world just waiting to help people.

"What have you given us," they complain, "that Mr. Forrester has not given us? At least he has given us a way to cycle in places where cycling is not encouraged." 

It was as if Forrester and his devote followers have kept cycling alive, during the dark ages of the 70's and 80's like Middle Age monks keeping writing alive.

Nothing can be further from the truth.

As I said, before, nobody rides VC.

By nobody, I mean less than half a percent of cyclist, who make up 1% of commuters nationally. This is a very small number!

Where did I get this number? From counting. If Forrester can do an experiment where he is the only subject, and the experiment can be conducted once, in secret, and we all have to hear about the results for decades after, I can do my own personal experiment where our number (n) is much higher, and I'll blather on about it. In my commuting for 3 years, I have seen only 2 people riding VC: 1 gorgeous, androgynous Godzilla, and a homeless person.

All the roadies were on shoulders or riding in pelatons on the OB bicycle path which is supposedly super dangerous, but nobody tells them that. They very happily drive their bicycles (for VC nuts, this means that they actually load their bicycles onto their car and drive the car--welcome to Normal SpeakTM aka English). As I was saying, they drive their bicycles to the end of the path then they race up and down the bicycle path. I almost NEVER see them the entire stretch of my ride to the beach on the 50 MPH roads which is supposed to be AWESOME for taking the lane. When they do ride on Pacific Highway, they are on the BUFFERED BIKE LANE. Haha.

Anyway, what has kept the flame of cycling going?

Ninja cycling (or NC for those in-the-know). 

NC is almost, but not quite everything that VC is not.

NC is not anything specific, but it's everywhere; it's all pervasive. Chances are you probably did some NC as a kid until you took a class that taught you to be thick.

NC is not a hard and fast set of rules, but it is fluid, adapting oneself to the circumstances.

VC cyclists want to be seen; NC cyclists want to be invisible. If you are invisible, you don't get harassed by police or otherwise.

Hear someone getting harassed? They probably didn't ride NC.

VC wears flourescent; NC wears black.

VC blames the cyclists, always; NC takes the cyclists side.

VC has a book or hard and fast rules, NC has no books. NC cyclists are too busy cycling to read a book on cycling.

VC is a limited path ridden by the very few; NC is for everyone with a bit of common sense.

VC has a limited view of transportation; they can only count to two. NC has an unlimited view. There are many, many ways of getting around and cycling might not be the best. You might need to put your bike on a bus, for example.

VC thinks that bicycles are either motor cars or pedestrians. NC knows that cycles are a third category, they are neither, but they are also BETTER. But not always.

NC allows for riding on the street, sidewalk, with traffic, against traffic, in malls, through alleys, bike lanes, cycle tracks. NC cyclists are safe anywhere.

VC teaches one to ride in traffic to "stay alive". NC teaches you to ride only when you are inherently safe. If you aren't safe, don't ride.

VC teaches you to ride in the street according to rules of the road. NC knows that riding a bicycle in the street where you are much slower, forcing faster vehicles to slam on their brakes and then squeeze by you is a total violation of the rules of the road.

VC has hard and fast rules. NC makes up rules as it goes along, it innovates and contradicts itself.

VC claims to teach one to ride logically and consistently. NC knows that humans are inherently illogical, and those who claim to be logical suffer from MORE illogic than most because they are blind to their basic nature and don't account for it. 

NC teaches on to ride based on one's perceptions, feelings, and in touch with one's environment.

VC teaches on to fight for their "rights to the road". NC will always have rights because it is invisible. Something that can't be seen can't be taken away. 

VC teaches cycling according to the LAW. NC teaches cycling according to compassion. NC cyclists will yield when they don't have to. If a tree falls when it's not seen, who knows? If a stop light is run when nobody is there to activate it then what. Such are the NC koans.

VC wears funny clothes and shows off every time it rides. NC is too busy riding to brag. It wears ordinary clothes and walks among us. You won't know an NC cyclist if you saw her off her bike. Perhaps she's somebody that you know?

VC thinks that the narrow few should cycle, NC is for everyone: homeless, fixies, BMX, even wheel chairs can roll NC. 

VC is fearful that it will lose it's rights; NC is confident that it can adapt to any situation.

VC revels in its strength and courage, NC offers refuge despite fear and weakness.

NC cycling has been around for as long as there is cycling. Long after VC is a distant memory, we will still be here, riding NC.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Effective Motoring Class</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[OK, I wrote this before DWF wrote the excellent comment regarding the esteemed John Allen's taking of a motoring "safety" class by a race car driver.

My class idea was much different, however. I was not going to teach one to push one's car to the limit nor keep oneself on one's toes. Rather, I was after a class which was analogous to the savvy cycling classes which have the tone that most cycling accidents are the cyclist's fault, only.

I figured if a motoring class existed, we'd be able to push the blame back on to the one who had the machine most capable of killing: "with great power comes great responsibility", a cliche that is not repeated enough in the cycling "safety" realm.

Since I never saw anyone else step up to the plate, I thought that I"d posit a new form of class called "Competent Motoring." (CM)

Basically, it would go beyond the basics of a driver's ed class and teach a more in depth understanding of the laws and rules of the road for effective motoring.

The premise is that if cycling is so complicated that we need to teach a 24 hour class, since an automobile has about 10x the parts of a bicycle and there are 10x more laws governing motoring, perhaps the class should be 240 hours? :)

I think we can do it all in two hours including the on street motoring.

Some of the ideas I have are:

1. Teaching the finer points of the traffic laws that are actually enforced. Also talking about laws that can be enforced, but are usually ignored. This is to create a more realistic view of motoring which is in contrast to driver's ed classes which teach unrealistic goals which students realize are BS and thus they ignore EVERYTHING that they have learned.

2. Opening a car door with one's right hand which forces one to look for cyclists.

3. NEVER ride in the gutter. Take the outer part of a curve at all times.

4. NEVER enter a bicycle lane except when one is turning, then look back and carefully enter the lane where the dotted lines are.

5. Look both ways even on a one way street for cycling salmon.

6. Give at least 5 feet of space while passing a cyclist and slow down. Also, never trail a cyclist by less than 12 feet in case the cyclist falls.

7. Overall, treat a cyclist like a slow car NOT a handicapped person. Being overly cautious is just as annoying as not paying any attention at all.

8. If a motorist breaks a traffic law such as running a stop sign or speeding, chase him down and give him a stern lecture.

9. Never tell a cyclist not to ride a bike. How about if every time you drove your car someone ordered you about telling you to ride a bike. You'd be super-annoyed.

10. Never get started immediately after a light turns green. Not all cyclists can make the light. Look first then go.

11. When coming out of a driveway, stop short of the sidewalk. ALWAYS. And look. There could be child running in front of you because he feels safe on the sidewalk.

There's much more, but you get the idea.

I envision this class signed off by government lawyers, engineers, and so on and the instructors licensed by the government.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Personally, I find that too many "rules" do not necessarily lead to better driving behavior. In the army, I actually had the occasion to be driven around by a few people who knew (and followed) the rules perfectly, but had absolutely no idea why they were doing any of the required steps! It was surreal - they were going through the motions, but they were not really "seeing the risks" (which normally are rather abstract in this context)! 

Perhaps a more effective way of getting these points across would be to require that driver education classes include components on cycling and walking. That is, teach car drivers how to ride a bike in an urban (and suburban) environment. And I would even add learning how to walk in such an environment as well - since most drivers are not aware of the challenges which pedestrians face. 

Nothing like perceiving the road environment from another perspective in order to promote understanding of why people do the things that they do. If drivers could identify with what other road users are perceiving, then there would be fewer "surprises"  (ie why did that cyclist suddenly swerve in front of me? becomes, hmm, I see a pothole over there, and that cyclist is heading straight for it; he/she probably will need to move out of the way somehow....)]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Rights to the Road Leads to Anomie</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/03/19/rights-to-the-road-leads-to-anomie/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[One who is an artist, knows that sometimes constrainst themselves can free us.

How so?

Let's consider the opposite: doing art with no rules. Instead of being liberating, as one might assume, no rules in art can lead to a feeling of hopelessness. When everything is possible, nothing seems worth doing.

In 1897, "Durkheim used the term anomie to describe this temporary condition of social deregulation, and anomic suicide to describe the resulting type of self-inflicted death; but in one sphere of life, he added, anomie is not a temporary disruption but rather a chrome state. This is the sphere of trade and industry, where the traditional sources of societal regulation -- religion, government, and occupational groups -- have all failed to exercise moral constraints on an increasingly unregulated capitalist economy."

http://durkheim.uchicago.edu/Summaries/suicide.html

What this means, is the Durkheim, in his research found that the people most likely to commit suicide were those who were disconnected from society. One thing that can make one feel disconnected is lack of boundaries that is unlimited freedom.

Thus, those people who speak only in terms of unlimited freedom unwitting advocate for mimizing one's chance at happiness and even laying groundwork for conditions where one is likely to commit suicide.

I feel that in the United States, the Left is especially lost regarding morality, and that they have given away any chance of moral authority by fearing limits to freedom and fear of talk of morality itself.

I feel that this fear has allowed people to feel that cycling itself is immoral. I feel this way because people sometimes find cycists "disgusting" and primitive morality came from feelings of disgust.

What does this have to do with cycling?

Well, for one, the whole notion of fearing environmentalism is wrong because this is a form of morality which everyone can relate to. Whether or not God created the Earth, the Earth has created us, and we'd be stupid and ungrateful AND IMMORAL bastards to ruin the planet.

When I see people who hate the environment, I wonder if they'd slap their mother around because the Earth is mother to us all.

Also, I feel that the whole idea of "rights to the road" and "freedom to ride everywhere I want on the road" is creating a feeling of anomie where if we can ride everywhere, we wind up riding not at all. Look at how often those who whine the most about Rights, ride. Not testing these "rights" much.

If we are "restricted" by cycle tracks, I feel that this is a healthy restriction. A cycle track means that the government and society in general is inviting us all to cycle. When I see a six lane road with no shoulder, I don't feel this invitation.

When I hear about the whining of the "nanny state" I wonder who raised these poor people. Nannys are loving and helpful. It's arrogant to feel that we are so independent as to be totally disconnected from all of society and as Durkheim pointed out, these people who hate their nannies are so disconnected from society as to have a much higher suicide rate.

So I say, if we are going to be restricted, let's do it all as a society, riding side by side in cycle tracks as riding off the road is the Right thing to do.

Those who go off on their own, we'll give them their space, but also let them know that the door is still open, there's still room in the fold. And if they kill themselves we'll be sad, but mostly we'll have the proper amount of love and equanimity.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Note, I just got back from DC where I feel that lobbying really makes a difference!

I'll write more later on the lobbying efforts as well as the VAST cycling improvements on DC and Philly. As for now, I am speaking of others when they feel that their lives are controlled by aliens...

Notice how often when people speak of cycling, they talk as if our entire legal system and built environment is held hostage by aliens?

This is the opposite of the truth. The government is full of people who crave to have active citizens to allow them to kick off the projects that they know that we, the citizens, want.

Don't believe me? Stop reading this, get out of your house and talk to some people in government. I'll wait.

No cheating. :)

Ah, you're back. I'll assume that everyone agrees with me now.

Anyway, the point is that you often hear people act as if we live in the Soviet Russia of transportation systems. "I _need_ my car because everything is so far away."

Really? Who put it "far away"? The aliens? Why is shit so spread out?

Because of zoning. Ah, I see so there are laws made in a democratic society which hurt us all. Well why is that? Because of politicians. But who do they listen to? Corporations. Who do they listen to? Aliens, just kidding, consumers. Not "consumers" is a way of talking about the public in a way which acknowledges their power, but only a little. Consumers only responsibility is to maximize their own happiness by selecting from a very limited number of choices put in front of them. Coke or Pepsi. 

I prefer the term citizen because it acknowledges that we have more responsibilities (and power) than we are told.

Zoning laws can be changed. In filling can occur.

Changing a law is slow. But there are exceptions all the time. 

For example, what's the maximum legal road grade allowed from a mesa to Mission Valley? Eight percent. 

But why are all the hills so steep then? 

Because they got an exception. That's right, one doesn't have to follow the law when designing the streets, we can get an exception. So the whole notion of deferring to standards, as if they were send down from on high by our Alien Overlords, is nonsense.

Any excuse from building infrastructure is a lie.

Look around. Everything you see is the work of human hands. Before humans made it, it was the product of the human mind, usually a single person's mind.

The whole traffic mess of malls in Mission Valley was a grand vision in a humans mind. Anything you don't like was probably created by humans who _decided_ to create it.

There's no alien race making laws.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[First of all, not all <a href="http://www.bikelaneliving.com/my-nyc-biking-story-sarinya-srisakul">firefighters</a> are against cycling.

However, I do argue that firefighters who complain about increased response times to emergencies are not speaking with genuine data but rather they are expressing their own personal opinions, only. Unfortunately, due to their position of authority, who'd question their expert judgement. 

Let's get started.

Let's look at a genuine problem which is hurting emergency response times right now: sprawl.

This is a major problem and has nothing to do with bicycle lanes.

I bring it up, however, as a litmus test to see how important increased response times are important to the local firefighters.

They are not.

There was no outrage about building these. In fact there are confusing 
<a href="http://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(09)00489-9/abstract">sprawl and cul-de-sacs</a> all over San Diego. Often cul-de-sacs thwart my desire to take a quieter route on roads where it is actually quiet and slow enough to share space with cars.

Therefore, if we really had any concern at all, in a real way, of addressing the problem of response times, this is the place to start.

No, instead we'll attack bicycle lanes. I posit that people who argue against bicycle lanes have no interest in response times of emergency services, but rather have personal anti-cycling views.

Here's an <a href="http://www.dnainfo.com/20101117/upper-west-side/fdny-split-over-whether-uws-bike-lanes-hamper-firefighters">example</a> where this notion is taken to the extreme.

"The fire apparatus is basically triple parked," said Murphy, the Uniformed Firefighters Association Manhattan trustee. "It'll be harder to reach certain floors. Eventually somebody's not going to be able to reach a floor because of the position of the rig and someone's going to get killed. I'm not saying it's going to happen next week, but it could happen down the line."

Basically what he is saying is that the bike lane and the buffer served as extra parking, along with existing parallel parking.

If he truly thought that cars parked along the street hampered fire fighting efforts would he not have just  argued for better enforcement? No, like many motorists, he assumed that there should be parking and that the bike lanes were there for additional private vehicle parking. 

If he really wanted to maximize fire fighting efforts, to "save a life", he'd argue against all parallel parking. 

This space: a bike lane, plus space where cars used to park, plus a buffer is wide enough to drive a fire truck! He would have created an emergency lane which is shared by cyclists. This has been used in other countries like Korea to significantly reduce response times.

No, instead, he wanted parking for himself, a travel lane for his car, and the fire truck, well, he had NO  provision for a traffic jam which is very common in NYC. I'd argue that more people died from sprawl, cul-de-sacs, and traffic than from bicycles slowing down fire trucks.

Bicycles can quickly jump onto a sidewalk in case of emergency while cars can not. So why come up with a plan that shafts the least offender?

Because he is personally against cyclists.

"But FDNY headquarters said there was no evidence to support the claims. [That bike lanes increased response times.]

The department doesn't track response times on a neighborhood level, but response times citywide for the first 10 months of 2010 were better than they were last year, said FDNY spokesman Frank Dwyer. The northern stretch of Columbus Avenue bike lanes were installed in late August."

Here's another 
<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCMQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oaklandnet.com%2Fgovernment%2Fceda%2Fdocs%2Fh10_why_bike_lanes_with_brt_draft.pdf&amp;ei=1o9nT6GKJYqKsgKE-IG3Dw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFz1Xl_DFIjwrSjkW456kDl3EO0hw&amp;sig2=LS1Gw0UG9Kf3myaXUbKv9w">paper</a> which lists increased parking for emergency vehicles as a reason for installing bicycle lanes.

Also, this question has been answered by <a href="http://www.completestreets.org/changing-policy/implementation-faq/">complete streets.</a>

"Complete streets and emergency vehicle access can go hand-in-hand, if the design process is collaborative and done right. The Congress for the New Urbanism, working with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Smart Growth program and fire marshals from across the United States, has created the Emergency Response and Street Design Initiative. The goal of the initiative is to pursue common ground and strategize how narrower, more walkable streets can serve – and even improve access for – emergency vehicles. More resources can be found on the Initiative’s website."

I am all for reducing response times for emergency vehicles, and I have shown, with five minutes of google and a moment's thought, a low cost plan which can help. Why I have to spend my time on this is beyond me. Why all the more brilliant people who are paid to do this have not come up with something better befuddles me.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Smaller fire trucks.  Yes, good idea.  There's an 80 year old estate here in LA being turned into a park, with a beautiful tree lined entry way used by the original owners, a seminary, a college, but now, as a park, must be widened because of fire dept.

I skid off the freeway in the rain once but was fine (could have died, or killed someone).  I just needed a tow truck to get the car back up the bank.  A huge firetruck showed up, took my pulse, checked my eyeballs and wished me luck.  Who knows how much that cost in gas, wear/tear, labor, etc.

Unconnected cul-de-sacs are bad.  Connected cul-de-sacs are good.  Berkeley's traffic calming and bicycle boulevards are essentially thru streets turned into cul-de-sacs.

Hembrow has several posts discussing how Dutch cities have restricted permeability for cars, with increased permeability for bikes/peds. 

"they waste resources" --  I don't see that, as long as they are permeable for bikes/peds.

"lack of community values" --  Only if you think the higher community on a cul-de-sac means less community everywhere else, but that's not true, it's not zero sum.  
Check out British term "Filtered Permeability" and Canadian term "Fused Grid".

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I also posted, previously, there are actually smaller fire trucks. If the arguments about traffic were really important (they are to me) to people then we'd be lobbying for smaller trucks. There is no reason why not. Firefighters are awesome, but if I were one, I'd probably want the biggest, baddest equipment, too.

About cul de sacs, I do see your point and like your ideas.

However, there are still many problems with cul de sacs from a safety point of view. Most of the reasons why people like them are the problem. That is they are there for safety, but they can be less safe.

Plus, they waste resources. They encourage lack of community values plus they encourage faster, wider through streets which suck the life from a community, increase car trip times, and create traffic woes.

The list goes on...]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Nice idea.  So cycle tracks, if they and the buffer are wide enough, could be an emergency vehicle lane.  Good argument for making bikes get their share of the roadway.  The Fire Dept. requirement for wide streets has always bugged me, but maybe it's a good thing in the long run if wider streets means wide cycle tracks etc are more feasible.

BTW, the argument against cul-de-sacs should really be an argument against culdesacs that have no thru path for bikes/peds.  Done right, culdesacs are a good thing.  Most of the ones near me have a short sidewalk connector at the top of the sac to the adjacent street.  So it's permeable to bikes/walkers, but not to cars.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Berkeley's traffic calming/bike boulevards are essentially regular grid streets that have been turned into cul-de-sacs for cars, but permeable for peds and bikes. 

Safety, resources, and community - yes, for non-connected non-permeable cul-de-sacs, but these are positives for bike/ped permeable ones.  Studies, reports, articles critical of cul-de-sacs have mostly ignored the benefits (and often the existence) of permeable cul-de-sacs.

I do like the idea of retro-fitting cul-de-sacs.

However, I do think that the notion of quiet streets and arterials is unscalable and selfish.

In my post "Let A Thousand Flowers Bloom", I talk about how I basically want ALL kinds of walking, ped, and transit infrastructure and nor idea of cul-de-sacs is a sound one.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Cell Phone Bans Considered Harmful</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Cell Phone Bans Considered Harmful

Here's the inspiration for this post:

http://bikinginla.wordpress.com/2012/03/26/distracted-driving-playing-a-risk-for-drivers-and-cyclists/#comments

I was going to comment until I realized that it was turning into a post in its own right!

Basically, I am against cell phone bans for several reasons.

The first is because I don't think that a ban would actually help make the roads safer. People will still text, but they will do so secretly which might actually INCREASE accidents slightly. 

Actually not using a cell phone would make the roads safer, but a ban is not always the same as magically changing the values of all motorists.

Second, cell phones are not the problem--distraction is.

I really don't see much difference between a motorist talking to a friend who is sitting next to her and one who is on the phone. Other distractions include the radio. I do suggest that one is safer when not listening to the car radio while driving. But most of us would not suggest making radios illegal in cars.

I have even heard that differing music causes differing rates of accidents with "Ride of the Valkyries" as the most dangerous song. :) *

Also, changing the channel of a car radio takes one's eyes from the road.

Similarly, a motorist can be similarly distracted while turning around to check on their child who is in a car seat. If the child were allowed to ride up front, they might be less of a distraction. Sure, car seats save lives, but I am pointing out that there are few safety measures that have NO drawbacks at all.

Would we ban all children riding in automobiles? This would save many, many lives, but again, I am not seriously proposing this because I think that it's absurd. Similarly, I feel a cell phone ban is also absurd.

It's not just about safety, but about utility.

And I'm not just defending a motorist's legal right to multi-task, as deadly as it is. I would like to decide, for myself, whether I can call someone while riding my bicycle or even listen to head phones. Usually, the answer is "no", but isn't it up to me?

Also, I'd like to add that there are positive reasons for using cell phones such as calling 911 to phone in accidents and crimes. I would not want these to be unreported just because a motorist is afraid of a ticket.

Incidentally, in San Diego, accidents are usually over reported which is why 911 is supposed to be all but useless especially on the freeway. Better response, I heard, is gotten by knowing, also, your local police station number so program that into your cell phone.*

Worse of all, though, is that a cell phone is a convenient distraction from the fact that our attitude towards motoring is totally off. Our built environment is too auto-centric which hurts enjoyment of the outdoors and cycling, divides up neighborhoods, steals money from the poor and gives it to oil companies, and kills us both quickly through accidents and slowly though chronic illness. Blaming a cell phone is a total waste of time as it takes us away from the bigger issues which is how our built environment is fostering alienation and oil dependence. If we had a safer built environment, collisions would be less deadly, and cell phone use would not be seen as big of a threat as it is now in our fast paced, high stakes transportation system which gives us the death penalty for a simple, normal human error.

In summary, a cell phone ban is only popular because cell phones are new. Other types of bans which can save more lives are seen as absurd, as they should be. Similarly, a cell phone ban is also absurd. A ban will not deliver on its promise of reducing collisions, but it will strip away benefits and comfort that we are accustomed to for no good reason.

  <title>Gendered Advocacy</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/03/30/gendered-advocacy/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently finished the book _Delusions of Gender_ by Cordelia Fine.

Basically, her point is that most of what we think of as innate, sex-related behavior--"dolls are for girls, trucks are for boys"--is actually the product of subtle socializing that is measurable in one year old humans. This is because even the most liberal parents, this side of an isolation chamber, teach their children gender roles.

After Cordelia's fine book, my bullshit detector goes off each time I encounter such phrases as "since I am a woman..." and "men are biologically programmed for..."

You might think that Cordelia wants to get rid of gender all together.

I think that she knows that this is impossible, and I'm not sure what her personal position on gender is exactly. Her personal story wasn't the point of the book. I do know that since she is a good scientist, she focuses more on how our society influences are experience of gender and less on prescriptions for the future of child rearing and for gender roles in general.

Overall, I feel that SOME gender roles are fun and harmless. I know few people who would like to live in a bland world where men and women wore fluorescent yellow vests, only, and, like dogs, we could only tell the difference by sniffing one another. I like to see my princess in make-up and a dress, but neither of us would like to see me in anything else but a man's suit.

However, like everything else, the party's over for gendered games when someone gets hurt. In an overly gendered world men can become stony, unable to laugh except at someone's expense, while the only entertainment they have are sports. Yuck! In the same over-gendered world, women can deny themselves, based on nonsensical beliefs, from realizing their potentials both inside and outside of careers. Ug!

This affects cycling advocacy as well. Many a woman has asked me where are all the women cyclists in our crazy, "take the lane" world. Many complain of being too scared to cycle.

I have said this before, I think that women's fears of cycling is brilliant, and it is one of the main reasons that they are so safe cycling, more than men. EVEN WHEN WE FACTOR IN THE LOWER NUMBER OF WOMEN, WOMEN AS A GROUP ARE SAFER CYCLISTS THAN MEN AS A GROUP. [I used all caps for the morons who skim and comment. I am not an idiot, and I realize that in good stats you must factor for things such as the total number of riders in each group and so on. Usually I leave this stuff out as I figure that people would realize that I am not a moron, but I am still treated like an idiot: "Did you account for the different number in each group?" Yes].

I have tried to emulate women's safer cycling abilities by choosing safer routes, and ignoring the nonsensical, macho nonsense that we get from uncycling thinkers. But I do dream of a day where just riding to work is more fun and less of a battle. It's not that I don't think that women can fight traffic, but I'd be an asshole if I urged them to do something that's stupid and dangerous.

This is where the Cycling Chic movement comes in.

"Cycle chic or bicycle chic refers to cycling in fashionable everyday clothes. The fashion concept developed in popular culture to include the bicycles themselves and bicycle accessories." [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_chic]

I love this movement because it takes something that is highly male gendered--see MAMIL: middle aged man in lycra--and it packages it in a way that is traditionally female.

Yes, I believe that despite being an illusion, gender differences should be used, when necessary for bicycle advocacy. And nobody does it better than Cycle Chic. This is because good advocates don't challenge every belief we have ever had. Rather they fit cycling into our own current paradigms.

With cycling seeming so dangerous, it's male by default. Most women, I know, don't want to hide their beautiful hair under a helmet, exchange their fine clothing for lycra, and battle with trucks for their "right to the road".

Normal men don't want to do this either! Don't mention the trans-gendered community which I am leaving out only because I know almost nothing about the individuals--but I am interested so if you have any info, please let me know. As a fan of Lou Reed, I definitely love transvestites as know how to properly enjoy playing with gender roles.

On the downside, here's an example of advocacy for women we don't need:

Here's an example: http://isocrates.us/bike/2011/05/cyclingsavvy-first-report/

"Cycling is a dance where you must lead."

Again, I don't mind being led in a dance by a woman, but most women are going to expect me to know the steps and to know how to lead a dance. Sure dancing might be sexist, but the only complaint I have heard from a woman is when a man doesn't know how to lead.

Now the cycling savvy people are telling women that they have to be expert dancers on bicycles leading a dance against bullies in automobiles? Plus, the photo of everyone wearing fluorescent yellow is awesome. Recall what I said about about the dismal unisex future? :)

I'm not a fan of clothing laws, but I do believe that if we made one, instead of addressing gendered head coverings and gang banger bandannas, we'd outlaw fluorescent yellow vests.

That's right, I'd like to be fashionable also, and Cycle Chic is a movement that includes us all. It certainly appeals to me as I love to rock a cute basket, and I'd like to get some more bling on my bicycle. Also, I'd LOVE to wear a suit as soon as San Diego gets around to traffic calming the highway that I ride twice daily. I don't wear lycra, but I'd prefer my built environment to reflect my values which is to create a place where riding in a suit is a lot less silly than it is now. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Cycling Got Us Into the Middle Class</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/04/02/cycling-got-us-into-the-middle-class/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I don't like to talk about my household economy too much, but I will say this: "cycling got us into the Middle Class."

It's true.

You probably hear about people bemoaning the shrinking middle class as well as rising costs of living and so on.

However, one thing you do not hear from the mainstream is that cycling is the answer to many, many people's budget problems.

People spend waaaaay more on their cars than they can imagine. Their metal and plastic "love affair" object is a greedy little bugger when it comes to wasting cash.

Just look at the cost of a college education when taking classes part time then compare to how much an automobile costs for a year. They are about the same!

Yes, if you have a car, and you think you are too poor to pay CASH for college then you are being robbed by your car.

"But I NEED my car!" you retort.

Yes, you do. However, people get on just fine without a car.

"But that's in other countries. America is different, here we need a car."

Why?

Because the built environment favors cars.

I have no doubt that it's impossible for many folks to get around without a car. 

This is because the federal government decided to make things impassible without a car. This was a choice that our government made.

If you feel too poor and own a car, and you have decent health, you are being robbed by the government.

We all know that technically, car upkeep fees are NOT taxes. Yet, if the government builds things so that you need a car, if is forcing you to have a car and all the associated expenses. So technically on your balance sheet it's not a tax. but it is money that is going away, forever, and giving you nothing in return.

I bicycle everywhere so I know that this is true. Each day, my bicycle gives me two workouts as well as two glorious rides in the sun that will be etched into my mind as memories until I die. Studies show that before you die, the biggest regrets is NOT doing things. Thus, the whole fear of getting hit by a car is gone. We are only sad about the exercise we didn't get. Physical activity is one of the things that we recall the best in old age. Not getting exercise is what we think of when it's over.

So next time you hear someone whine about how they have no money on one hand. Then the other about how they absolutely NEED their car on the other, you know that they are getting robbed.

A decent built environment is tax relief for us all even if we can't technically call it that.

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The whole "fear" thing is VC bullshit.

I didn't ride because I got over the fear but because I rode on the sidewalk. This was in Philadelphia.

Now Philly has buffered bike lanes all over the place and there are way more cyclists than when I was there.

If I started cycling here, I would never have done so. No amount of fake stats and expensive classes whould have helped. 

I'd still be stuck on the hampster wheel of paying my car payments...]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[When I got to DC after a six hour marathon tv watching session on the flight there, I was exhausted. Thus, I slept while princess ran off the the convention.

Later, I woke up and crossed the street to get on the metro. That's right! DC is so convenient, I can get on a metro from my hostel door by crossing a traffic calmed street. I was so close to heaven.

My luck improved when I got on the train. 

"Unbound!" I heard someone exclaim.

I am used to hearing my name called all the time, but usually it turns out that the person was talking to or about someone else. Thus, I am slow to respond to my name. But it was called again, and I looked up to see the Obi One Sleeper Agent from San Diego!

This man is truly amazing. He's very calm and knowledgeable, helpful, and kind. Definitely a role model for who I am to become in the next few decades. One of the few cycling thinkers from San Diego. I could go on and on about how much we love and adore him.

I sat down and had my first one on one conversation with him, ever.

He talked about how many exciting ideas coming to San Diego.

There's the Center For Disease Control study which shows the relationship with body mass index and the design of residences. As part of their study, they are doing the most detailed count of cyclists and pedestrians that was ever done in San Diego.

The counters are called Echo counters and they count cyclists, only, not cars. Then there's the infrared counters which count cyclists and pedestrians, but pedestrians can be found by subtracting cyclists from the Echo counter. These counters are going to wirelessly stream data! 

At this point, Obi One and I got to the convention, and we sat down for our first meals in DC. I met an advocate named Warren from Dallas. He talked about how he could ride anywhere using the typical VC stills that he had learned years ago. However, he realized that if he were to share his passion for cycling, he had to get more infrastructure built.

I bit my tongue regarding my usual approach to VC and just listened and learned. I felt that he was ideal in many ways regarding advocacy, and he reminded me of most of the best crop of advocates. They can ride anywhere, but they want infrastructure anyway. According to Quislings, these people should not exist because the desire for infrastructure stems from an irrational and superstitious FEAR of cars. Because cars, like toothless bunnies, are totally harmless and don't kill the most young and healthy people each year. :)

Warren also talked about how nasty the VC crowd was and how off putting they were. He noted that they had some good ideas, but they were just plain impolite and mean. This made me feel bad because I, myself, and really mean, too. I hoped he didn't find my blog as I was so embarrassed by my approach. I mean, I  had a religious background (Catholic and Buddhist) which taught me better. Still, will I persist in my low humor and nasty remarks about those who oppose normalizing cycling?

Yes! :)

It's like what CK Louis says about eating animals, "clearly it is wrong, but I don't care." :)

Anyway, I had a very nice meal except for subtle friction with the wait staff who was totally micro-managing my meal. 

Do I look like a kid who attracts the mom element in the food service world? Probably. :)

  <title>Motorists Against Motoring</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I am writing this post because I'm super-annoyed at the whole notion of cyclists against motoring.

This is going to be a repeat, but I wanted to get this all in one concise post so if you heard it all before, skip this post.

Basically, the main notion is that motorists are the biggest haters of motorists. More so than most cyclist advocates, though if you read any internet comments, you wouldn't know it.

Why do I say that motorists hate motoring more than the rest of us?

First of all, in the cycling advocacy world, we do have some fear of getting run over. Imagine some bad dudes who killed 700 of your fellow country men? Then imagine that the US government, police, and court system works in lock step to make sure that the penalties are as minimal as possible for their deaths. Would you be upset?

Probably waaaay more that most cycling advocates are.

We realize that it's in bad taste to complain, at all, about getting hit by cars. We are too dedicated to our cause to alienate the power base of the US who all happen to be motorists. Thus, we keep mum about how angry and hurt we are when we confront motorists. But if you imagine a group who's more successful than all of the terrorists combined at killing Americans? We're way less pissed than that. 911 comes once a month in the motor vehicle death world and we get jaded after a while.

Still, motorists are under no such restrictions about complaining. So whenever you hear a motorist bitch about parking or traffic, they are really whining about other motorists sucking up their resources. 

Also, regarding cycling, why don't more people do it? Ask a motorist about cycling. They will complain about their fear of *GASP* getting hit by a vehicle similar to the one that they own and operate every day.

I'm sorry if the truth hurts, but this is truly a head scratcher to me, and I'll never get over the marvel of it all.

Here are some questions that I will never ask outside of the keyboard cowboy world of online postsing:

"So you are afraid that a car will hit which is horrible, noisy, scary, and prevents you from riding a bike. So how do you get around? In the same manner that makes you scared?"

So what would make cycling easier for these people? Infrastructure.

Build it and they will come. Every closed off street that I have ever seen, in the middle of the city, is full of people!

Heck, build a bridge for bikes and pedestrians, only, and you won't find parking nearby for those who want to park and walk across the bridge.

People LOVE open spaces. They LOVE places without cars. This is doubly so if they are motorists. There are never enough of these things.

These things can ONLY be built by the government. The "free" market will not build free open spaces.

So basically we love something and know how to get it. Why don't we build it?

Because we don't want to pay for it.

This is an insight that I got while at the summit. Basically, we ALL (tea bagger, liberal, libertarian, conservative, VC nuts, climate change conspiracy theorists) all of us want open spaces. Trust me, you'll find a VC nut teaching his two year old how to ride a bike on a closed street which he claims is super-dangerous and NOT La Jolla Drive which he claims is super-safe.

We ALL love open spaces. We HATE to be near lots of LOUD traffic.

Why do we make things so shitty?

Because we are too CHEAP to pay for our values. 

That's why this whole "limited government", "austerity", and "tax relief" nonsense has to die. I'm willing to pay more for my values.

Tax collection is a legitimate way for our government to raise revenue, and open spaces are something that we are all willing to enjoy.

Why are so many of us such stupid cheap skates when it comes to making their world nice?

When I hear anyone but a minimum wage earner bitch about taxes, I put them in the same mental space as a dead beat dad.

  <title>Amazing News Story: NO BBF</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/04/05/amazing-news-story-no-bbf/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[http://www.thedesertinde.com/Regular-Articles/Blythe-Police-Reports/2012/Jealous-Woman-Attacks-with-Car--0328.html

I got this from the comprehensive Biking In La Blog:

http://bikinginla.wordpress.com/2012/03/31/a-long-list-of-events-from-a-bike-friendlier-malibu-to-a-new-september-date-for-this-years-tour-de-taste/

The funny thing about this story wasn't what was there, but rather what was NOT there.

We did not see any mention of whether the cyclist were wearing bright, clownish colors. We didn't hear whether they were wearing a helmet nor were they blamed on riding badly: wrong way cycling, in the bike lane, in the travel lane, on the sidewalk--usually no matter where a cyclist rides they are blamed if they are hit by a motorist.

For once we get a news story with no BBF (blame bicyclist first).

Probably the reason for this is because we know that the motorist tried to hit the cyclist which is why we see this:

"Dominguez was later booked into the Blythe jail for assault with a deadly weapon and for making criminal threats."

Assault with a deadly weapon? Say it ain't so.

In many cases I have seen a DRUNK driver drive away after hitting a cyclist.

So this story brings a tear of joy to my eye.

On the other hand, I know we will have more BBF in the future. For this, I try to think of why we have it.

First of all, there's those who motorists only. For them, cyclists are really hard to see which is why we need to stay in predictable locations aka not in their way. It is very possible for someone who is well meaning to hit a cyclist totally by accident. It can happen. This is one of the main reasons I hate driving: because I don't want the responsibility for someone else's death.

Second, there are the VC advocates who use cyclists death for their own purposes. They, too, are part of BBF, in part, because they'd like to believe that they are safe while riding their bicycles (they are not).

In reality none of us are totally safe. That's life.

Here's to hoping for a world where a minor error in motoring or cycling does not equal a death sentence.

Here's to a world where shitty motorists get the help that they need to reform their lives rather than the lockstep protection from all the ranks.

Motorists take care of one another (unless one is a crazy criminal and there's a full moon). :) 

When there's any way out, the motorist will give doubt to their fellow motorist. They'll even make things up to defend a fellow motorist.

Why can't cyclists, at least, give each other the benefit of the doubt?

No more helmets, silly bright colors, lights, classes nor self-appointed experts.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>A Categorical Mistake?</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Long time readers know my current obsession with how language shapes the way we view the world, especially vague language and imprecise langauge.

Previously, I have noted that there are many ways of looking at our "right to cycle."

However, I have now realized that there is a bigger problem with cycling advocacy which is the fact that "cycling" itself if not one thing.

We all know about the two main types of cyclist in San Diego, the roadie who wears lycra and rides on bicycles that are as expensive as some cars and lighter than my rear bicycle rack. They spend most of their time on shoulders of fast paced roads, and they often ride in packs or "pelletons".

Then there are the beachies who wear flip flops and ride beach cruisers that have less handling than a tank. They ride mainly on the boardwalk, but also on sidewalks and sometimes on bike lanes, at times, the wrong way.

The former group run the political aspect cycling in San Diego while the later have no idea that there is politics.

What they both have in common, however, is that a bicycle is merely a toy. Thus, they don't really need to worry about getting anywhere safely or comfortably.

For those of us who are commuters, aka the third group, we need to ride on certain roads because that is where we work and shop.

When it comes to advocacy, the needs of the first and second group clash, but since the second group doesn't care, only the first gets to speak to those in power. 

Yes, there are commuters who are interested in their "rights" aka no infrstructure, but I have never seen someone ride VC, the whole way to my job. Nor have I met any VC cyclist who does not have access to a car.

But there's more. The fourth group is the mountain bikers. They are similar to the first and second groups in that they don't _need_ to cycle, but they tend to like infrastructure anyway just in case they want to ride to the coffee shop. Mountain bikers are probably the nicest group, from my experience, and the most conscientious of both the environment and of the average commuter's needs. Plus mountain bikers tend to become commuters, and I call mountain biking, the "gateway" drug of cycling.

So far, I have listed four groups that have divergent needs, and there are still more such as the BMX crowd who is know for willy-nilly cycling, but if you actually talk to them, they have a method to their madness. Plus, like the commuters, BMXers are actually using their bicycle as transportation much of the time. 

When one talks of cycling advocacy, whom are we talking about? Each has different needs and their views of "rights" differ greatly.

But since we use one word for all these catagories, we tend to think that our needs are the same and that any cyclist can speak for any other cyclist. Not true.

Throw religion at the mix and things get explosive with fixed beliefs that building cycle tracks will result in slower cycling, massive deaths, and the inability to ride a bike anywhere that doesn't have Dutch inspired signage.

As I said before, unity is NOT the answer. In fact, I see the call for unity as a way of censoring people's voices.

<a href="http://onthelevelblog.com/2010/06/15/a-sad-chapter-in-bay-area-bicycle-advocacy-history/">Here's</a> an example of where this "we speak for all of you" idea has gone sour.

Note, that I am highly biased as I really like San Francisco and I highly admire the people in their coalition and what they have done for cycling.

"So, seeing that the system had totally failed, Janel plans to help mobilize a protest last Friday that captures widespread media attention and galvanizes the support of motorists and cyclists alike to finally close the dangerous gas station entrances on Fell, and what does she get?  Fired from her bicycle advocacy job.   You heard me right."

Should they have fired her? No. Am I surprised? No.

These things happen.

But my point is that we need to constantly speak out with our own voice without fear of "confusing people" or "diluting our message" or "showing disunity". These are the words where people try to strong arm the rest of the group into their mold.

I do think that we need to kick our governments more to do more for cycling. We should not expect anyone else to speak for us unless they are in our group, and we can trust that they actually speak for what we want.

Thus, we must demand more specific language. No more fuzzy phrases like "rights to the road" or "more education."

Like Janel, we need to ask for specific things to be built, for example, a cycle track from my door step to my job would be nice. :)

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Media Gets "Stop De Kindermoord" Totally Wrong

Yesterday, I caught the tail end of the excellent ride which was meant to re-enact the "Stop de Kindermoord" protests of the 70's in the Netherlands:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuBdf9jYj7o

Of course, the retarded media got it totally wrong.

http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Bicyclist-Killed-Near-Balboa-Ave-Remembered-2012-146144685.html

"Friends of Pacific Beach resident David Ortiz, 29, are holding a "memorial ride" Wednesday to honor their friend and raise awareness for safety hazards on San Diego streets."

OK so this last paragraph isn't the worst in the world, it does have that irritating nonsense phrase "raise awareness."

In the Netherlands, they have complete infrastructure for cycling which has shown to prevent deaths like Ortiz's.

This was what the ride tried to accomplish. Not at once, but by telling City Hall that their cheap-ass, "we don't have money for bicycles" is creating dangerous conditions and that they should show some responsibility and fix things.

On the broadcast version, at least, they only talked about how "drivers gotta pay more attention."

Or what?

That's a totally empty statement because it doesn't really have any specific things that the city can do and it has NO teeth.

They also mentioned that Ortiz was "allegedly" hit which is ridiculous. People saw him get hit by three vehicles. What more do you want? Allegedly is used where you have not established something as fact. 

"Allegedly" the motorist was following all traffic laws. "Allegedly" the motorist who hit Ortiz is the driver of that vehicle. We don't know these thing until we verify them in a court of law.

Unfortunately, this young man is in reality a fact not allegedly.

Anyway, the entire paradigm of the news story was actually a motor vehicle ad. It basically made cycling out to be a super-dangerous thing in which the responsibility for safety lies wholly on the cyclist. Oh motorist need to "look out more", too which is like saying, "I try to recycle when there's a recycling bin." I'll do the right thing, just don't bug me too much.

The thing is that I'm OK WITH HUMAN LAZINESS. Human nature has not and will not change.

Humans are lazy because water flows down hill, we try to conserve energy which means not thinking too much and following our habits. If you have no way of changing all of our habits, your solution is totally useless.

That's where infrastructure comes in.

I ride my bicycle in the areas where David died, and it totally sucks for cycling. Only the government can change that unless I become really rich and the government takes privatization to a whole new level and sells me a freeway and a couple hundred surface streets.

Until then, to blame anyone but the city for creating a situation where fallible humans fall into fallible mistakes is totally biased and not journalism at all.

Shame on the idiotic media for perpetuating myths on cycling.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Meet Your New Overlords</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Like everything else, the first freeway started with a vision, an impossible, absurd, over-priced, and ridiculous idea.

When it came out many, many people found problems with it.

Yet, now we assume that freeways were always there; that they were inevitable.

The same is true for an excellent built environment.

The problem with many advocates is that they ask for far too little. Way less than people are willing to give. Way less than the average person thinks we should have. 

This might be one of the reasons for the gap between what we say we want and what we have.

Here's a great quote from Janel on this:

http://onthelevelblog.com/2010/05/26/the-subtle-censorship-that-defines-acceptable-discourse/#comment-4034

"@onthelevel: I agree, a sentiment often develops that the organizations who speak for and represent the movement are on top of the issues and are working in our best interest. That they know what they are doing so we don’t need to get involved unless we are told what to do.

This is not wise, especially when those organizations may not actually be doing much to further a cause, as is the case with many environmental orgs that are now getting funding from polluting corporations and other orgs that benefit from the status quo.

When those organizations that have a reputation for being progressive are depended upon for representing and acting in the best interest of the common good, but they don’t follow through, nothing gets done and nobody questions why.

I think this is a major reason for the expansive gap between what people want and our current state of affairs."

Fantastic ideas, but what has she actually done to put these ideas into action?

The other day, I linked to a sad story about her, but there's a happy part I'd like to focus on.

Here it is again for those who missed it:

http://onthelevelblog.com/2010/06/15/a-sad-chapter-in-bay-area-bicycle-advocacy-history/

"Many months ago, after being nearly knocked off her bike in front of the Arco station on Fell St.,  Janel asked the SFBC what was being done to improve safety along this critical thoroughfare...Janel plans to help mobilize a protest last Friday that captures widespread media attention and galvanizes the support of motorists and cyclists alike to finally close the dangerous gas station entrances on Fell..."

The reason I love this so much is that she points out the elephant in the living room. Motor vehicles are dangerous, and some things need to be taken away such as parking and entrances when they endanger our lives.

This seems like common sense, but there's a fear out there. Not of motor vehicles, but of being seen as "anti-motoring".

This fear is the kiss of death because it's being used as a lever to bully cyclist advocates now. And we are falling for it. We are so willing to suck up to motorists so that they will give us crumbs, we can't even properly articulate the problem.

While I do agree that we should have good social skills and advocate in a way which maximizes our chances at results, we won't get what we don't ask for.

And if we can't even focus on the real reasons for our problems, how are we going to figure out a solution?

Following in the same vein as this advocate is Timur. He just came to San Diego from North Carolina. However, he has all ready organized the Ortiz ride, and he has tons more innovative ideas.

It's no accident that both these advocates are forming their ideas outside the traditional power structure.

I am wondering how many more shake-ups we will see.

I predict that the future engine of cycling advocacy lies in the minds and hands of the younger generation while older people like me and others are further marginalized by these fresh, radical, and sane ideas.

I welcome my new overlords of advocacy!]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Glare Planning</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/04/11/glare-planning/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Regarding the recent cyclist's death, here's a relevant law:

"V C Section 22350 Basic Speed Law.
No person shall drive a vehicle upon a highway at a speed greater than is reasonable or prudent having due regard for weather, visibility, the traffic on, and the surface and width of, the highway, and in no event at a speed which endangers the safety of persons or property.
Amended Ch. 252, Stats. 1963. Effective September 20, 1963"

I find this sad because the police did not make an arrest despite the fact that the woman confessed that she broke this law.

Every time someone claims that the weather made it impossible to see someone who didn't jump out in front of them, they were going too fast by law. (I'm not a lawyer so this could be totally off.)

The funny thing is that we have this kind of weather almost every day!

When riding a bicycle, into the glare, I do ride very slowly. But there are cars flying past me. 

Since we know that this is a problem, and it happens all the time, why are we not mitigating this problem.

I am going to posit that this is due to a disorder that happens when thinking about planning around motorized vehicles called "Chronic Vehicular Helplessness."

This is a problem that crops up to those who carve up mountains in order to guarantee their cars a six percent grade or less yet they are totally stumped by problems such as glare, which happens all the time.

Glare is not an excuse for car accidents in Southern California.

If a rock fell out of the sky and hit the perpetrator's car then, yes, there's a valid excuse. You can't plan for these things. They just happen.

Glare does not "just" happen; it's a way of life.

My solution for everyone, when driving into glare, to drive twenty five miles an hour.

That's my idea.

There are other ideas too. One of them is to spend the money to fix the glare problem. I don't think this is a bad idea because human life is precious, and, like I said before, we have all ready spent billions to CREATE this problem. This problem  didn't occur by nature. Humans CREATED roads which are dangerous in glare. 

So please, can we own up to our own part in things and make things better?

Option B is to spend the money on easing congestion aka making the roads faster so more people speed in glare and more people die.

Guess what the Powers That Be decided?

So the next time someone whines about glare making them kill someone remember that we allowed people to build this system which we KNEW would kill people. Let's be more responsible.

  <title>VC == FAST Riding</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[OK, I'm really sick of going over this nonsense over and over again.

Actually, I lied, I'm not. I can repeat myself all day, but I usually choose not to because it's rude and the whole ad nauseum argument is a turn off and makes people hate you.

This is _my_ blog, however. :)

Here's another recent debate on my comments:

Me: I never read a single VC rider suggest that perhaps a slower speed would make things safer in bike paths and  cycletracks.

Trevor: Every time people write that European style bikeways may not be the total answer you’re looking for if you want to make a transportation network that serves everybody, the primary point is that those paths are only safe at very low speeds. 

Me: I'm confused. The VC people keep changing the subject. For ages, they have married themselves to safety. Whenever Forrester talks, he speaks of safety.

Whenever we go to kill bicycle paths and cycle tracks it's due to safety.

Now it turns out, due many, many studies, that cycle tracks are safer. There's no getting around that. This is a fact. Bicycle safety has been studied to death in the US and abroad. In fact, bicycle safety regarding infrastructure that remains unbuilt in the US is much, much more studied the our vehicular roads despite the fact that bicycles riding on bicycle paths kill almost nobody while cars riding on AASTO approved streets kill more people than Super-Predator Children, terrorists, and insane people combined.

While the normal, "legal" streets continue to kill people, there's no outcry from motorists. Meanwhile, we hear continual whining, threats, and even lawsuits to stop bicycle infrastructure.

Why is this?

Because VC cyclists are lying.

They say they care about safety, but once safety has been established, their mask comes off and it was all about speed all along.

Here's the deal.

Next time, you want to kill a bike path or cycle track, go to a meeting, and SHUT UP ABOUT SAFETY. Talk, only, about how you like to ride really fast and you can't stand to have dog walkers, children, and other slow cyclists in your way. Instead, you are solely interested in blocking traffic while riding a super-slow 18 MPH.

Trevor: I would not ride my bike to work if it took me four times as long as in a car. It works for me because at an average of 18mph I can write off the extra time as free gym time.

Me: I this, and I that. It's all about you. What about the 60% of people who want to ride, sometimes, but are too afraid because you and your kind of have stopped many, many safer, more fun places to ride?

18 MPH is SLOW for a road. Even a road which is 30 MPH (rare in SD) this is really slow. It's totally selfish to take a lane and make people pass. It's also really dangerous, and it has been a total PR nightmare for cyclists. Telling people to do this is making motorists hate us to the point that they don't want to give us anything.

We were offered quite a bit in the 70's and Forrester shot all that down. Now they hate us and give us nearly nothing. Thanks.

Trevor: I started to ride my bike on busy arterials on the sidewalks. I knew from the get-go the only way it would be safe is to travel less than 10mph, and to stop at every intersection even if the light is green to check for people turning their car left or right across my travel path. Soon I became more fit, better skilled at spinning, and it was not so fun to do all that stop-and-slow.

Me: Me, too. But remember, you can have safety or fun but you don't get both.

Trevor: People who like to ride in the road don’t want to take away the rights of people who don’t. They just don’t want their rights taken away any more than you obviously feel yours are by the opposition you hear.

Me: The whole "rights" debate is total nonsense. For one thing, my right HAVE been taken away. I do NOT have the right to ride in safety, comfort, and efficiently thanks to Forrester and others. I know this for a fact. There were plans for paths to go to my job. They have been killed by the VC community.

So, please, unless you advocate for cycle tracks everywhere, you very much are advocating against my rights.

I have written a whole post about rights. I wrote a whole post about how I WANT to divide the cycling community because it's not really division, it's revealing abuse of power and lies that have been going on for a long time. It's also a way to recruit the 99% of the people who are not insane and drive in San Diego because it's too annoying, difficult, and scary to ride a bicycle here.

Trevor: Also, bicyclists who like to ride with other smooth-flowing traffic are actually people, and they concerned about the health of other people who may not be aware of the hazards they have learned to avoid. 

Me: Traffic flows smooth for you because you are the slowest thing on the road. What if you were the fastest? You'd be pissed off. VCers get pissed off when they have to yield to pedestrians. Motorists feel the same about you. They might not run you over, but they hate you. Some of this hate spills over to me.

Trevor: It is no surprise to me when I see many of the crashes that happen between car and bike, and it is sad when I know it is a missed opportunity to have explained to those two people how they could safely work together until the roadway is fixed to make it less necessary to have such expert training. 

Me: Show me where the VCers are advocating for cycle tracks and NOT for classes and "education" and I'll sign up for this.

Otherwise, we are going to work against each other.

Trevor: I wished I could keep my kids from falling down and getting “owies” just as much as I try to prevent them from more severe tragedies.

Me: Again, we disagree. I do NOT want anyone to be hurt, but pain is part of life, and small mistakes do hurt. These should NOT be high stakes and fatal. The whole notion of mixing with traffic makes what should be small learning experiences to be deadly.

Trevor: Please fill in your mental trench with mulch so it will grow some daisies to cover the hurt you may bury there. I suspect this writing isn’t cathartic, it’s only vitriolic.

Me: Too true. I'm really angry about the recent accidents and the failure of the police department to do anything about it.

I'm angry that the NYPD (and others I'm sure) has a policy of letting cyclists killers go if they can find any excuse for them at all.

Everyday I have to play the high stakes game of merging with 50 MPH traffic, I get pissed off at Forrester and his stupid ideas.

Everyday.

  <title>Let's Ban Cycling</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/04/13/lets-ban-cycling-lets-ban-cycling-lets-ban-cycling/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I don't think I have ever seen this one before so if you have then I guess I've been scooped.

The notion is that if you are as dumb as I am and spend more than a few milliseconds on message boards, you'll notice some posts that seem to make sense, but are fucking stupid. So stupid that I believe that these people should be tracked down and their driving licenses revoked because they are too dangerous on the road.

First of all, here's one of my own ideas.

Idea #1:

If we know that profiling works because we spend a lot of money on it for terrorists, how come we don't profile dangerous motorists? I mean people are being arrested because the authorities can't read tweets properly so why don't we track down the real killers. By this, I mean drivers who threaten cyclists even as a joke?

I don't know why but my only two conclusions are:

1. The profilers are not smart.

2. The profilers have no real concern of keeping us safe.

Motor vehicle accidents kill as many people as 9/11 each month.

If we had ignored the 9/11 threat, and focused on motor vehicle accidents there could be over 300,000 Americans alive today. That's the size of Buffalo or Pittsburg or three times my home town.

I have a better idea:

Idea #2:

Let's ban cycling.

Before we do this, let's get a cost benefit form. First of all commute times will speed up a lot. Instead of an annoying cyclist that takes two seconds to pass, you'll be sitting behind that same cyclist, the whole trip and looking at his smoke belching in your face. Since he's driving a truck, it will take you more than 2 seconds to pass him, but you can't because that other cyclist is in the passing lane. They are both driving really slow because they are not good at driving. But you can't say anything because they are not dirty cyclists any more. They are gas tax paying citizens and we know that these people are the best. Those who don't pay the gas tax should be killed--but I'm getting ahead of myself.

OK, let's run the numbers. Even if a ban were free because we can pay the extra bicycle police salaries with the couple of bucks that we get from the handful of suckers who actually did cycle commute. What about obesity?

The health care costs would likely off set any gains in--well, I don't know. I don't see a big financial win for banning cycling. Roads will break down faster. Commute times will be flat or even go up. Oil will be the same or higher. There's actually no real benefit to this plan.
Health care costs would go up. Of course, we could just let these people die off by banning heart attacks and diabetes related complications from the ER, but this would hurt those who were faithful motorists their whole lives and not cyclists. 

Basically, this is too expensive for no real gain.

Idea #3:

Instead of banning cycling, we could make it a pain in the ass. This is a "poor man's ban". This is by decriminalizing killing cyclists deaths. We could harass cyclists, and mock them in movies. When they die, we could blame them. We could make up some bullshit, useless safety ideas like plastic helmets that don't really help against a crushing injury of a car, and basically make out anyone who cycles to be crazy. We could build things so you NEED a car then blaming cyclists for not buying a car with no job, you need a car for that, with no money as you need a job for that.

Basically make cycling a living hell, and tell them that they still retain the "right to the road" and that they should be treated "equally"--meaning a living hell--to any vehicle.

This is all ready done.

Idea #4:

Force cyclists to ride on the sidewalk so they stay out of the way of cars.

The problem is that sidewalk cyclists annoy pedestrians and thus this can never happen because pedestrians aka motorists who are walking to their cars--will not allow this.

Idea #5:

Since we did nothing for cyclists, let them ride in the road so they don't bother pedestrians.

This is the original problem. Cyclists in my way. So annoying not to kill someone when it's so easy like a little kitten or grandma on life support.

This idea fails because motorists are annoyed.

No.

Idea #6:

Let's build special places for cyclists to ride where they don't annoy anyone save for those who are too old or stupid--those who insist that idea 5 is a good idea.

No. 

If we spend a dime on cyclists it's too much. Our gas tax money doesn't even cover roads, we have raided the general fund to get the extra money, but sshhh don't tell a motorist or he will run you over.

This idea is a total fail.

Idea #7:

Let's do the minimal possible so people think that we care. We can draw little lines on the road or pictures of bicycles either in aluminum signs or on the road from time to time. Let's not get crazy; let's make sure that the minor paths and lanes don't connect up to anything, but leave cyclists as stranded as a road that goes off a cliff.

Let's mourn cyclists from time to time, but mostly blame them, if they have no helmet, or flashing lights or so on.

Let's say "yeah bikes" but do nothing of real substance.

Let's offer classes that teach idea #5, but have no real enforcement for it.

Let's create a system which is a hodgepodge of nothing which will save the maximum money. Cyclists will be unsafe, motorists and pedestrians will be pissed. It will be the worst of all worlds, but it will be cheap!

This, my friend, is what we have picked.

The worst of all worlds.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>New Rules For Advocacy: Newbie Edition</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/04/16/new-rules-for-advocacy-newbie-edition/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[When talking to a Newbie, Do:

1. Tell her what kind of bicycle to get. If she's really unsure, LISTEN to her needs and TELL her what bike to get. Don't say, "I can't really say." If you read this site, you are smart enough to help. Go with her to the bike shop if you have to.

2. Go on rides with her, if she wants you to. 

3. Say hello to every cyclist that says hi to you. Stop to help everyone if they need it. 

4. Let the slower cyclist lead unless you are leading someone into unfamiliar territory. Otherwise, you'll constantly leave her in the dust, get frustrated, and so on. She knows when you are frustrated even if you are trying to cover it up. If you can't stand to watch her go slow and make mistakes while you shut up, don't ride with her anymore, it's not worth the aggravation. And keep your eye on the road not my ass. :)

When talking to a Newbie, Do Not:

1. Pressure them to ride a bicycle. Pressure them to buy a bicycle. #1 above assumes the person wants to ride on their own. If they are your spouse, STFU about cycling and find out what he wants to do instead and do that with him. If he loves you, he'll ask to go ride with you. If he doesn't get it, dump him. :)

2. Don't complain about motorists or safety. Don't talk about how much cars pollute. Don't complain about being treated unsafe or having inadequate facilities.

3. Suggest that the person needs to take a class to ride a bike. A bicycle is really simple and a child can do it. It's an insult to imply that a cyclist is dumber than a child which is what you are doing here.

4. Criticize her bicycle. No matter how stupid you think it is, she loves it. It's part of her now and if you mock her bike you mock her. Do NOT give her suggestions on traveling lighter or any other kinds of advice at all. Unless she asks. Then answer her question, only with a sound bite. Don't go on and on about it.

5. Offer to help someone if the problem is beyond your skill level. Many women can change patches better than any dude. This is a fact. So don't think that just because you have nuts you can fix a flat.

6. Tell the cyclist to ride on the street when they want to ride on the sidewalk. Warn them about the door zone. Don't lecture any cyclist on safety at all. Don't talk about helmets. If you think any of these things are important you probably don't know what you are talking about anyway. An LCI is not a degree in public safety.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Cycling Humor 101</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/04/17/cycling-humor-101/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I know that there are a great many people out there who have no sense of humor so if you are part of this group, you can stop reading now.

The whole point of this is to amuse and to inform.

After all, the worst thing that a motorist can do is to suggest that I, as a cyclist, have no sense of humor. 

Just because I don't laugh at the motorist's One Joke does not mean that I have no sense of humor.

You know the joke, "I'll try not to hit you. Just kidding. Haha."

The reason we don't laugh at the joke is not because we are thin skinned, humorless weenies. If we were like this, we wouldn't ride because you need a thick skin and a sense of humor just to stay sane. And if I'm not sane, why are you joking around with a crazy person? Try clowning around with the mentally unstable and see what happens. Haha.

The real reason that we don't laugh at the motorist's One Joke is because it's over used. If you want to clown around with a cyclist do a few things first: ride a bicycle so you actually have some perspective, learn how to tell a joke, and most importantly of all, TELL AN ORIGINAL JOKE. IF YOUR BIKE JOKE IS NOT ORIGINAL, DON'T TELL IT.

If your joke is funny, I'll laugh. If I don't laugh, stop the wise act. You can't fake funny.

I don't care if you want to round up all the cyclists in the county and shoot them in the face. If that's part of your joke, and you can make it funny, I'll laugh. So it's not "sensitivity" or any of that PC nonsense. I like offense humor. I like insult humor. I love being teased. Just get some new shit instead of recycling other people's trash.

The other reason that I don't laugh at the One Joke is because it's not a joke. A "joke" isn't a way of cowardly stepping away from your position. If you want to run me over, do it. Don't say something offensive then say "just kidding". A joke has to start out as a joke. Plus, "I'll kill you" is something that a terrorist says, not a comedian.

So by all means, tell some jokes. God knows we need more laughing in this cruel world. But make it good or don't make it all.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Often this is done to get under your skin.

It's a common trick to do something like this via plausable deniability. When you snap, they look innocent.

On the other hand, sometimes it's just due to having nothing else to talk about.

I suggest NOT answering the question.

Ask them something polite, about food or something else non-transportation and non-contraversial.

Or smile and say nothing.

This will piss them off if they are trying to get you pissed or it will help them relate and like you if that was their goal.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[In the light of cycling humor, I came up with some of my own. It's better and more original than the motorist's One Joke.

1. Recently, a motorist hit a cyclist. The motorist said that the glare blinded her.

The State of New York usually gives blind motorists:

A. Driver's license
B. Acquittal from killing someone due to disability
C. Commendation for killing the "enemy" in the war against motorists
D. All of the above

2. In what cases are cyclists solely at fault for their deaths while the motorist in the vehicle is totally innocent:

A. Rode bicycle on the sidewalk
B. Rode bicycle on the street
C. Rode bicycle on the bike path
D. Rode bicycle on the bike lane
E. No lights
F. No helmet
G. No bell
H. Driver had a bad day and hit the cyclist on purpose
I. Cyclist was smug and self-righteous
J. Cyclist had children on the bicycle
K. All of the above

3. In #2, if we fail to find criteria to exonerate the motorist, who is blamed for the accident?
A. Motorist
B. Bad road design
C. Fate
D. Cyclist's mother for giving birth to her.

4. If an officer hits a cyclist, will he be punished?
A. Always
B. Never
C. Only if they scratch the paint on police car

5. The New York State House debated a bill to make it open season on cyclists. The bill:
A. Failed to pass due to humanitarian reasons
B. Failed to pass because cyclists are too tough of a target for guns, hitting with a car is more convenient
C. Passed
D. Failed to pass because it's more fun to and satisfying to hear the crunch of the cyclist beneath a truck

6. A motorist confesses to killing a cyclist. You:
A. Toss out confession
B. Lie to media, blaming cyclist anyway
C. Visit cyclist, against her wishes, in the hospital and try to coerce her into claiming that she "fell off her bicycle"
D. Cook up a story about anonymous officers who were there to see her fall of her bike, but somehow were not there afterwards to help her
E. All the above

7. Based on the two prosecutions out of the twenty eight cyclists deaths in New York last year, one motorist equals how many cyclists
A. One. We are all US citizens who deserve equal protection under the law
B. Less than one tenth. (Do the math).
C. Zero. (Unless the motorist is poor AND the cyclist is rich, famous, or a judge. In this case, do more for a cyclist than you'd do for ten motorists.)

  <title>Land Transport Safety</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I really didn't wish to go to "Woe are we" types of posts on cycling as this is supposed to be the unicorns (the person not the strange horse) and smurfing cycling blog. :)

However, in the wake of the recent accidents and the lame ass response that the police had which shows that they will not stop until they exonerate the criminals who run down cyclists something that was supposed to be done by private lawyers.

They are continuing to pretend that the "law ties their hands."

I think that they enjoy being cuffed.

Basically, after 9/11 police powers have been vastly expanded to protect us. Overall, I think that this is great! More power to stop the bad guys. This seems to have been working, too. Unlike the last president, under Obama, there's been not one domestic terrorist attack on American soil that killed anyone. 

So far so good.

But what is terrorism and why is it so special?

I don't know. I hate stupid arguments about vocabulary.

But we can all agree one thing that terrorist try to do is kill Americans. In response, we have spent a lot of money to stop this. I say good. But there's a huge blind spot.

Why are we not targeting motorists?

Because they don't drive cars, silly, you say.

Really? I retort. Did you know that the FIRST 9/11 bomb was via a truck? If they had been checking trucks in 1993, they could have saved some lives. 

But we can't target transportation for terrorism. To equate transportation with terrorism is silly.

They what's the TSA all about?

Also, check this out:

http://transit-safety.volpe.dot.gov/security/Newsletters/html/Vol19/default_m.htm

"Land Transportation Antiterrorism Training Program.  The Land Transportation Antiterrorism Training Program (LTATP) was developed by the U. S. Department of Transportation and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC).  LTATP is unique in its design, recognizing that security at most land transportation systems is accomplished by a cooperative effort of Federal, State, local, and contract personnel.  This program was designed to protect the land transportation infrastructure, which includes rail, mass transit, and bus operations. "

So we are targeting EVERYTHING except for the thing that kills the most people. Sounds like a GREAT use of money.

But the _potential_ for harm is greater with other forms of transportation.

I really doubt it. And I doubt that this is going to reach its potential any time soon.

Fact is that we are INUNDATED WITH MONEY TO STOP MOTORISTS FROM TERRORIZING CYCLISTS. We have the money, we have just decided to conveniently exclude motoring from the list.

If you think I'm cherry picking, you can go on and google for this. Only motoring is excluded from anti-terrorist spending.

But there's more:

http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=20&amp;ved=0CHsQFjAJOAo&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fops.fhwa.dot.gov%2Fpublications%2Fetopr%2Fbest_practices%2Fetopr_best_practices.pdf&amp;ei=vmaMT_36EKSdiALR-6jtCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFU80DeYnzkLa0jy2KAadVsh7U6tw&amp;sig2=q5_E91xLEXZccYouXCJKsw

Notice what they do:

"Use of Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) to
Monitor Freight Rail Movement—One region’s
TMC can monitor freight rail movements on one
rail corridor to see direction of travel, length of
train, etc. The major city in the region also has
cameras on railroad tracks throughout the city so
they can see when a train is blocking a street."

Makes sense. If someone gets run over by a car and dies, it's not terrorism. But if a train blocks traffic and nobody dies? That's what we are looking to remedy with our government dollars.

So we totally ignore motorists?

Nope. We help them:

"Motorist Assistance Patrol (MAP)—Several
regions have established motorist assistance
patrols on their highway systems, to assist
motorists with vehicle troubles."

Note who they do not help? Those who are too poor to have a car at all. If you don't have a car, they are not there for you.

Furthermore, if you have a car bomb, they won't know because they are not checking.

But if you WALK, you are really a threat: 

http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/Terrorism/antiterrorism_chill.html

Dissent, Public Safety Core of Debate
    Ed Whitfield and his followers just wanted to hold a peaceful demonstration during President Bush's recent visit to the Triad, making it clear that not all Americans are gung-ho for the war on terrorism. Police, sheriff's deputies and the U.S. Secret Service simply wanted to protect the nation's chief executive in a time of great national tension. The two goals met head-on during Bush's July 25 visit, when the protesters were stopped as they walked along a public road on which motorists traveled freely. They had to discard their protest signs before being allowed to proceed along Grandover Parkway in southwest Greensboro, News &amp; Record, August 04, 2002

Great, but our "civil liberties" protect us from rounding up and detaining anyone who drives a white Lexus, right?

The U.S. Justice Department must release in 15 days all the names of those it has arrested and detained in its investigation of the Sept. 11 hijacked plane attacks. "The federal government's power to arrest and hold individuals is an extraordinary one. Here, the government has used its arrest power to detain individuals as part of an investigation that is widespread in its scope and secrecy," U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler said in the 45-page ruling, Reuters, August 2, 2002

Nope, they can. They just choose not to.

The point is that the government has unlimited powers to protect the 700 cyclists and 33,000 motorists who die each year, but they choose not to.

Most killer motorists have a record of bad behavior. They often brag about how they are going to kill people before they do it.

Seldom do you see someone snap.

After a motorist attack, it's very possible to round up all the suspects and check them out, but instead authorities are there, in lock step to protect the criminals.

My suggestion is to pressure your public officials to use the powers that they have been granted to start targeting the real threats and stop lying for and otherwise shielding those who choose to kill their fellow Americans.

They have the power, but they choose not to use it.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA["Unlike the last president, under Obama, there’s been not one domestic terrorist attack on American soil that killed anyone."

In light of the Holocaust Memorial Museum shooting in 2009, the Fort Hood shootings in 2009, and the Austin IRS attack in 2010, I'm reminded that "those that forget the past are doomed to repeat it." Those events also should remind us that terrorism and it's victims are nonsectarian AND nonpartisan. Its perps are likewise. And yes, those perps are more likely to use a truck than a bike as the instrument to wreak their terrorism. I would appreciate a retraction of a demonstrably untrue statement that is not central to the point of the post. Besides, Bush is not eligible to run in the upcoming election...]]></wp:comment_content>

These recent events got me feeling sad, and they got me thinking.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[In the light of recent events, I am still mourning, upset, etc.

But let's not let our emotions get in the way of the facts.

We are going to hear a ton of misinformation about cycling: blame bicyclist first, self-justification, empathy for the one most like us, etc.

Over and over, again, I hear the whining, selfish pleas of tea baggers who don't want a dime of their gas money to go to cycling.

Guess what, it doesn't and it won't, but it should.

Item two, cyclist who own cars pay into the general fund. Where's my transportation money?

So if anyone mentions gas money, let them know that gas money on pays for parts of roads, road costs are going up, gas money is going down. The difference is made up by taxing non-motorists and building roads that are very dangerous.

So one proposal I have is that if you think that it's too expensive to pay for cycling infrastructure, stop maintaining roads all together. The easiest ways to get around San Diego have the cheapest roads. Conversely, the most expensive roads suck the most for cycling.

When thing break down, a little, cycling gets way better. So the issue isn't that we want to take your gas money for our sissie bikes, but that we are being taxed, and having our money used against us.

Most of us are too polite to mention that, but I'm the impolite one who says what everyone else is afraid to say.

Let's just stop building and maintaining all roads starting now. Shut down the street lights and lay off the traffic cops. Things will get worse before they get better, but ultimately, we will be riding on mountain bikes on trails that are hacked out by private volunteeers.

Another point is that cycling infrastructure always has to be decided by the "community". Each tiny little strip of paint must be fought over with the dumbest, loudest, and most selfish community members.

At the same time, the freeways were built by fiat. If we had to argue over every single inch of freeway space (people lived and worked along most of what is now smelly, noisy, and economically bankrupt land), freeways would never be built. Or they would go at 60 MPH for a few blocks then suddenly disappear into a brick wall just like bikeways which dump you into the middle of an ocean of cars.

And if this doesn't convince you note, that the founding fathers did not ride SUVs. 

Even if they did, would their first priority be to steal (tax) money from those who did not have cars to give it, as an entitlement, to those who did?]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Safety Bullies</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[One argument that comes up over and over again in the cycling world is safety.

I have posted various posts where I alternately mock or condemn safety or where I propose some real solutions which will increase safety.

Like the TSA, there are a couple of plans for safety which have never been shown, in the real world, to increase safety. Like the TSA both of these are "safety theater" giving some people the feeling of safety but not actually making them safe.

We get ad nauseum how riding vehicularly and wearing a helmet are safer.

What we do NOT get are controlled experiments showing how, in the real world, these policies actually make us safer.

In fact, common sense tells me that both of these are stupid. I will change my mind when I get some data.

And NO, I do NOT have to prove that a helmet is UNSAFE. I can tell you that putting a plastic bag over your eyes and mouth make you safer. You won't do it without proof. Likewise, I need proof before I wear something as silly a flimsy bicycle helmet. In fact, I still won't, I will choose to be slightly less safe.

Through the years, rode my bicycle with no helmet and NON-Vehicularly (sic) and I have been almost 100% safe. We can only judge things on how they were and they were fine. Thus, there's no point for me to change.

Yet, there are those out there who insist on wearing a helmet.

Let's get this clear for the dense:

I DON'T GIVE A FUCK IF YOU WEAR A STUPID HELMET. I AM NOT TELLING YOU HOW TO LIVE YOUR LIFE, DON'T TELL ME HOW TO LIVE MINE.

Yes, I am against helmet wearing for commuters. I am FOR wearing helmets for racers, mountain bikers, and other cycling risk takers.

Even though I am opposed to helmets, I do NOT bully others to follow my way. I NEVER tell people to not wear helmets on the street.

However, the facts on helmets are in. Helmets have not been shown to reduce injuries.

http://www.cyclehelmets.org/1068.html

Helmets DO hurt the popularity of cycling badly. See the Australian study.

End of story.

HELMETS ARE USELESS FOR SAFETY, BUT THEY HURT CYCLING.

THOSE WHO PUSH FOR MANDATORY HELMET USE ARE HURTING CYCLING POPULARITY.

What I really hoped to talk about today was bullying, a theme I see come up over and over.

Asking someone, one time, to wear a helmet is not bullying.

Pestering someone over and over again to wear a helmet does not make one a full scale bully, but it is using bullying style tactics to achieve a pointless aim. This is a gray area, and I am mainly talking about how I (and others who choose to cycle without helmets) feel.

"According to Pamela Lutgin-Sandvik,[5] the lack of unifying language to name the phenomenon of workplace bullying is a problem because without a unifying term or phrase, individuals have difficulty naming their experiences of abuse, and therefore have trouble pursuing justice against the bully."

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workplace_bullying

I DO REALIZE THAT SOME ASSHOLE IS GOING TO CHERRY PICK SENTENCES HERE TO PROVE THAT I AM A BULLY. IF YOU FEEL THAT WAY THEN STOP READING RIGHT NOW. DO NOT COMMENT. PROBLEM SOLVED.

Discounted the person's thoughts or feelings ("oh, that's silly") in meetings (64 percent).

"People who don't wear helmets are stupid."

"Harshly and constantly criticized having a different standard for the target (57 percent)."

For example, we have to wear helmets because they are slightly safe for minor falls, but we do NOT have to wear wrist guards which are much more effective for an injury which is more likely. Nor are we urged to wear flack jackets despite the fact that shootings are more common and harmful than minor head injuries that helmets protect us from.

"Overevaluation and manipulating information (for example concentration on negative characteristics and failures, setting up subordinate for failure)."

See the misquoted, flawed, and much abused study on helmets: "Helmets prevent 85% of deaths from head injury for cycling accidents."

"Preventing access to opportunities"

You must wear a helmet or you can't get credit for randoneering nor ride Bike the Bay.

"Having your opinions and views ignored"

Despite the fact that there are many reasons to NOT wear a helmet including a study which showed that one is less likely to be hit by a car from behind while NOT wearing a helmet, these are ignored and we are subjected to the continual verbal vomit about how one fell one time and their helmet broke and now they are really safe now.

"Being humiliated or ridiculed in connection with your work"

If you don't wear a helmet for long enough you'll see what I mean.

Overall, the problem is that of the helmet advocates being extremely ignorant of the big picture. They go around bothering those of us who have read all the studies and positions for helmets. We have gone over the history of cycling and the why's and how's of helmets. After all this, we have come up with an informed decision to NOT wear a helmet which should be a personal decision like how often to floss.

Instead we are harassed by cyclists who fear that we will "look bad" without a helmet.

I am bald, but if I had some nice long hair like most women, I would NEVER wish to bunch up my glory in a sweaty helmet. 

And there are still men out there who wonder why their lovely wives do NOT want anything to do with cycling. We look around and wonder where all the female cyclists are.

Stop being a know it all. Stop bothering and harassing us for our personal decisions.

Oh, I don't have time for this, but often wearing a helmet is a form of domination (as well as bullying). It trades a phony feeling of safety so that motorists feel better about themselves: "He wasn't wearing a helmet [so he deserved to die]."

Thankfully, for some reason the San Diego media is wising up that obsessing over helmets after someone dies is unnecessary and disgraceful.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[It is awesome to know that you have the same vehement hatred toward being told what to wear as some bicyclists have towards being told how and where to ride in the roadway. It's some kind of common ground.

By the way, many bicycle riders do actually feel safer when they wear a helmet. No matter how many times I tell them that it's better to avoid falling, and that helmets are only designed to give some safety in low-speed falls, somebody will always give an anecdote with flawed logic "my helmet was destroyed, and I am alive, therefore the helmet saved my life".

I've learned to ignore every behavior I don't agree with unless it directly affects me. So no more picking on people wearing dark clothes at night and having no lights either. Unless they are riding the wrong way towards me, that is.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for trying to find common ground.

I feel that cyclists should stick together. I have met some LCI's who are actively working towards infrastructure. Perhaps you can join them (I'd say "us", but I'm not an LCI).

I do believe that having cycle tracks and being harassed are two separate things. I get harassed most often on roads which are high speed with no shoulder. I call these roads VC roads, but they are also the rural roads that Cross wrote about. Did you read the orignal Cross study, the one that VC is based on? If not, please forget all you know and read it.

As for dark clothes, I read a study that means that they don't help.

Still, I DO wear dark at night. Why should I be solely responsible for the behavior of motorists?

Why are dark cars legal if bright objects are easier to see and are safer?

Does the law make things deliberately dangerous?

The point is that "wear a helmet" or "wear bright clothes", when it comes from a clueless motorist is an attempt to avoid personal responsibility by passing it on to me. It also is a domination tactic where they leave out the implicit threat: "Wear light clothes or we will kill you." It's like clothing laws in the Middle East.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Net Global Happiness</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[In many ways, I cycle merely from the force of habit. If I were actually from San Diego, and my parents bought me a car, I would certainly drive.

Now that the bloom is off the rose, and I see pollution and the violence of hundreds of motors passing me very closely rather than palm trees, I have thought about motoring to work. The more I learn about how our government operates, the more I see the ownership and daily operation of a motor vehicle being a prerequisite to being a full US citizen.

However, I still don't want to drive.

One of the reasons is pride. I never realized that until recently.

The other reason is pride in my body. I get stronger EVERYDAY OF THE WEEK. While others are getting more and more flaccid by the minute, my body is getting harder and more sexy. I would hate to give this up, and I think I'd rather die than give up  cycling.

This is a great feeling being able to say you are willing to give up your life for you mode of transportation.

Another reason is happiness, however.

Recently on <a href="http://bikinginla.wordpress.com/2012/04/25/cyclist-describes-brutal-sunday-assault-by-road-raging-ventura-blvd-driver/" title="Biking In La">Biking in LA</a> there was an article on a cyclist getting assaulted.

This reminded me of a recent study which showed that if you are holding a gun, you are more likely to think others are holding a gun instead of a banana or a wallet.

I wonder if a similar study won't connect road rage to the way that motoring is set up. If so, is it practical and human to put us in a system where we are forced to have our nervous systems primed for violence. Sounds like a cruel experiment created by a team of sociopathic scientists. :)

I do agree with Ted about letting things go in most cases. However, I wonder a few things. First of all, what does this mean for the next generation? Is this not the broken window theory in reverse?

"As a number of comments in the long, long thread made clear, stopping to confront an angry driver is never a good idea."

Yes, Ted, I agree for so many reasons.

On the other hand, I wonder how things got so fucked up in our world. In almost any other case, I COULD confront someone and have a civil discussion, patch things up, and move along my way.

I feel that the reason that many people act so badly in cars is because it's too easy. They are too detached from society in their car and they feel safe. This is similar to how cyber-bullies operate.

I had a friend who constantly trolled me on the internet but acted like a friend in real life. I finally emailed him to not email me again, and he was shocked and hurt. He was just having fun.

Fun for him, pain for me.

The funny thing is that motoring was supposed to make us happier, but it makes us sadder.

Many people report that the worst part of their day is the commute. On a bicycle, it's easily one of my best parts of the day despite the fact that so many assholes want it to suck. It's still fun, bitches!

Thus, since I am happier and not contributing to the general anger and sadness that comes with motoring, I'm contributing to global net happiness, and that makes me smile.

The tiny country of Bhutan wanted to measure net happiness rather than GNP or GDP. More happiness each year meant success.

I feel the same.

So no matter what bullshit people tell you, you _are_ doing a good thing by cycling. The haters of the world were shitty people before you took the lane, made them pass, delayed them two seconds, or made them feel bad about their lack of exercise or environmental concern.

So smile and enjoy your ride fellow cyclists or as a British friend dubbed you "Little Christs of the Road."

You can kill us, but we die with a smile, bitches. Suck on that! :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Inside Out</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[My new obsession is the notion of coherence. That is, I'd like my actions and my stated goals to work together.

The analogy was how white light scatters quickly while a laser of the same power can be seen much further away due to the fact that the light is coherent.

Overall, since I'm super lazy and unambitious, the idea isn't really to accomplish a great deal, but rather just to get out of my own way.

One of the problems I have had with coherence for years is the problem of my meditation practice.

One of my biggest goals is to give things up, to do with less, and to be happy wherever I am and however I feel.

On the other hand, I do have the hope to try to make my world a better place.

This seemed to be a conflict because why would I need to make the world a better place if I were happy all ready.

Conversely, if the world were perfect, I'd have less incentive to meditate and to give things up because everything would be so lovely.

This morning, I resolved the dilemma as I realized that it is a false dilemma. 

My error was creating a duality between my inside and my outside. I realized that I could work to make _both_ inside and outside better.

There's no point in worrying about things being too perfect. The whole idea is to incrementally make things better forever.

If I do reach a stopping point, the Earth will be a Paradise, and I will be enlightened.

Not a scary outcome at all.

Otherwise, I will have a continual supply of things to do.

Last weekend, I worked out a similar conflict regarding Right Speech. 

http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sacca/sacca4/samma-vaca/index.html

I realized that the reason I didn't want to practice Right Speech was due to laziness and to greed.

Laziness meant that instead of saying things nicely, I'd just quickly dismiss them as stupid. While this did save me a lot of time and grief, perhaps I should work harder to be nicer even to people who are total idiots. :)

Secondly, perhaps I should try less hard to get attention which is another reason I say mean and otherwise unskillful things.

I'm not making any short term promises, but I have a commitment to becoming a better person both inside and out. This includes a better built environment which takes into account needs of cyclists and pedestrians.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Lessons From the Sky</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I have probably written about this, but when I ride my bicycle, I like meditate sometimes. Usually when I am on the high speed roads, I can not meditate.

But once I get into some nice, juicy, infrastructure, I can finally relax and allow myself to truly feel my body. These are the moments that I ride for.

When I can not meditate, when my mind is spinning far too much from the pollution, noise, and the hassle of being the eyes and ears of not only myself but of everyone who is lucky enough to be born in the this tiny slice of time, the Oil Slice, where motoring is cheap and easy.

One of these times, I accidentally looked up to the sky and saw that it was far more vast than the pettiness that I was suffering beneath it.

This corresponded to one of my chants:

"Look in all directions.
Watch all space.
All space."

And I resolved to look at the sky as much as I could (when at stop lights and so on). This practice has made me happier.

Looking at the sky reminds me of the other Buddhist saying, "We are all dying fish in a drying pond, fighting for the last bubbles of air."

I try to realize that the fight for space on roads where we are hopelessly out gunned--don't bring a carrot to a nuke fight--is pointless.

I have always hated the phrase "right to the roads" because I think that by its very nature is inflammatory and those who "fight" are the kind who will fight no matter what.

"The universe is limitless.

There are countless galaxies.
There are countless worlds.
There are countless sentient beings."

This makes me think of all the other planets--heck all the other countries and how different things are here.

When we saw the Danes, it was like a superior intelligence coming to see us from another place and time.

If we are only 1% different genetically from apes, these Danes are at least another 1% more superior to us.

Read anything from Denmark or the Netherlands on cycling and it's like a breath of fresh air blowing in from the North. It clears my mind and makes me realize that everything in my wildest dreams about cycling is everyday for them.

I think about this, and the advice that princess has given me.

We must shut the door on the past and forget all we know.

"There are countless sentient beings."

And there are countless cities where people actually do get it. Where they realize it's not about "rights" or "lateral movements" but about people relating to the space around them.

The universe is much, much bigger than we ever imagined and we are blessed to have an intelligence, a very human intelligence who wants to help us.

If only we are intelligent enough to let them. ]]></content:encoded>

  <title>National Bike Summit: Standout</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I have not written any more about the bike summit because I don't really have the energy. I have a few more pages of notes, but I don't feel like typing them up. Most of the important events were covered elsewhere.

One other thing that I am going to write about is strategy which comes in dribs and drabs.

The last thing I do have the energy to write about is the people.

It was so good to meet great like minded people as well as reconnecting with the people I all ready know.

There was one person who stands out in my mind.

She seemed to have come out of no where.

I first met her when I was coming out of the hotel, on the first night. I was going to a party that a good friend had invited me to at a nearby bar.

Outside of the hotel, I saw a woman assembling a folding bicycle with a hex key.

I thought it was strange that it needed tools. Plus, princess had talked about us getting folding bicycles. 

So I started what I thought would be a quick conversation about what tools were needed to assemble this folding bicycle.

The conversation lasted the rest of the night. I hope, one day, it will continue.

Soon we were talking about many deep things including advocacy, philosophy, and values.

I can't tell you all the details, but she was truly an amazing person, and I had an excellent time.

My only regret was that princess was preoccupied and thus could not meet Kristen.

Kristen was currently living in Pittsburgh, but previously, she had been living in Switzerland for years.

She was forced to come to the US, again, probably due to career choices.

She talked about how great cycling was in Switzerland and how backward the US was.

She showed me a brilliant virtuous circle of how we have values, then we pay for them, then we see the benefits which in turn reinforces our original values.

Those who are too cheap to pay for their values break the virtuous cycle.

 There was much, much more, and I can't tell all of it to you, but you should realize that there's a new advocate in town, and I'm happier for it.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Phase Shift Cycling</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/05/04/phase-shift-cycling/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[There's a nice analogy for cycling that I like to think about which is a phase shift.

To give you some background: the human mind normally assumes that all change is gradual and linear. This is a reasonable approach for a great many things, and it's possible that the human mind thinks linearly because our environment usually consists of linear change.

On the other hand, sometimes, there are abrupt changes, and these can take us by surprise.

For example. If you have ice which is -1 C degrees, you find that it's solid. As you pass zero, you will see an immediate and dramatic change.

Nothing about changing the temperature between -10 and -1 degrees C is going to prepare us for what happens when we pass zero degrees.

In fact, regarding infrastructure, you're going to hear people say that it's never going to happen in their lifetimes. This is just like saying that the ice will never melt because we keep giving it a little heat and it doesn't change much.

Here's an example of what I am talking about:

http://dc.streetsblog.org/2012/05/01/fhwa-small-investments-in-bikeped-infrastructure-can-pay-off-in-a-big-way/

"The last transportation law, SAFETEA-LU, provided four communities with four years of funding to build an infrastructure network for nonmotorized transportation (a fancy way of saying “sidewalks and bike paths”). It wasn’t a lot of money...

"An estimated 32 million driving miles were averted between 2007 and 2010. It appears that the numbers keep climbing — half of that savings happened just in 2010, the last year of the pilot, when an estimated 16 million miles were walked or bicycled that would have otherwise been driven."

Wow.

And here we added only a little heat to the pan.

Imagine the savings we'd get back from a REAL investment in infrastructure. It would pay for itself in so many ways.

So when you see a bike path that's not used and say that it's a waste of money you'll remember that this is a block of ice. We've heated it from -10 to -9 degrees and we expect it to melt. How silly.

We need to reach a critical mass. Then we'll see lots of change all at once.

Cycling infrastructure will bring about a phase transition in cycling. Let's heat the stove rather than letting room temperature take its time...]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The reality is that most people would like to ride occasionally but can not or will not because the government has spend a lot of money with no thought to anyone but cyclists.

The reality is that negative comments about infrastructure, such as your own, has set back cycling by 30 years or more.

In reality, cycling in San Diego is barely possible.

In reality, nobody in San Diego rides my route VC. Nobody.

VC riding is NOT realistic where I ride. I have challenged many people to ride my commute VC.

I and many of those I love have been personally maligned and attacked by the VC crowd online.

In reality, I have squandered a great deal of time and energy trying to empathize with people like you.

In reality, VC people have NEVER spent a minute contemplating my point of view. NOT A SECOND.

In reality more bike infrastructure has been built in the past decade than has in the past 30 years before. 

Why? The places that have the most cyclists and the least deaths are those that freed themselves from the clutches of the VC crowd.

These are all irrefutable facts.

To say it's OK to ride now is saying it's OK to make minimum wage forever. If you have a job, why go for something better?

In reality, the world is becoming a better place.

In reality, your comment sparked me to make some new comment policies.

In reality, a small amount of money pays off. That has been proven by the study I posted. 

Reality ALWAYS makes VC people angry which is why then NEVER give any facts or logic, but rather spout personal attacks, smarmy undermining, and non-sequitors. I don't want to waste my life like this.]]></wp:comment_content>

One item really scared me: "In each community, a greater percentage of pedestrian and bicycling trips included transit in 2010 than in 2007." Are they saying that the USG is even succeeding in getting cyclists off the road via buses? Greater PERCENTAGE? I'd hate to have to burn my transit pass in protest!]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[In reality, I'm not sure HOW we disagree. I view myself as a transportational cyclist. I ride from point to point - over whatever the options are. VC is the main option where I ride. It defines an approach, not an identity. As I've said many times, I am NOT an advocate. I want to go places without being compelled to do it via car. Which brings us back to the first sentence. And the difference. I ride in what the world IS - whether that be ideal or shit. You wish for what you want it to be. Follow your dreams. I'll follow reality. No need for debates...]]></wp:comment_content>

I think for the VC stuff, we have to agree to disagree. I'm focusing on moving way beyond all this.

I have researched the subject for over a year, pouring over stats and so on. The conclusions I have reached are based on data and experience on a bicycle in many cities.

You are free to disagree, but please don't try to pull me into debates as they drain precious time and energy which is best served moving forward not backward.

The best infrastructure is not yet thought of; the best places to bicycle are not yet built.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I have decided to move on.

That is, I feel that my thinking was shackled by unhealthy ideas, and that refuting them was sucking up a lot of precious time and mental energy.

If we fight off a cold, once, we don't want to shut down that part of our immune system and re-fight the cold again, do we?

Thus, the arguments I have had, I am trying to pull my sticky mind away from them once and for all.

While riding to work, I have some rough ideas.

1. We must unshackle ourselves from useless phrases and ideas. These include "rights to the road", "be careful for what you wish for", "this will never work here", "and cyclist are not morally superior."

Same for criticism. We should just ignore it.
 
Useless ideas are usually vague. They often speak in dualities, ignore penitent information, bring in unnecessary facts, and they often distort reality.

2. Cycling must come first. We must not let people tell us that we need to mitigate ourselves. That's for them to figure out.

Thus, we shouldn't worry about what other people think, about removing parking, or any other tiny arguments which will never be resolved.

Tiny ideas will lead to tiny fights which will not solve the huge problems we are facing.

3. The future will come from both the imagination and data.

We must imagine a better world for ourselves. Think of #1 and how people are so negative. "I can never ride because of X."

I have found that with a little imagination and #2, we can do what we didn't think was possible.

But we are NOT just dreamers. We must get peer reviewed data on everything. This is helpful because there are many people who request more and more data.

On the other hand, too much data is also bad. Thus, we shouldn't get bogged down.

There are many things that we don't have to prove. Cycling is fun, healthy, and good for the environment. Anywhere that's halfway decent for cycling gets people to FLOCK to it even if they said that they hated bikes.

So we must get just enough data to make a decision and no more. 

4. We must move fast. We don't have a lot of time to dither.

5. People are affected by their surroundings in a similar way no matter what the culture is. We don't need to reinvent the wheel. The human mind is a learning machine, and is very flexible.

Things that seem confusing, scary, and strange become quite normal after a very short time.

6. We can do everything. That is, in an ideal world, we will have proper education, infrastructure, and enforcement. One of these will not solve the problem. Improving on one of these will help all of these.

7. We can determine how healthy a city is for cycling. While there's a lot of things we can measure some of them can obscure the truth such as looking at fatalities in a city where nobody rides.

Thus, the best measure of cycling is humans especially women. If they are too scared to ride or say phrases like "it's no practical" then cycling in that city is sick, and it's up to us to make it better. The humans who want to ride are healthy--the city is sick.

Laws, classes, and wishful thinking are not enough.

We have to judge the tree by its fruit. If we have been doing something and the patient is getting sicker, we are wrong and should forget all we know to learn from those who have healthy patients.

By this measure, San Diego is an example of a very sick city while Copenhagen is a very healthy one. The main thing that San Diego can teach Copenhagen about cycling is how we got our disease.

8. We can adapt our environment. Cycling is 100% compatible with American values and can fit into our current infrastructure. 

If we can't picture that, we aren't thinking big enough. 

When we build freeways through a city, and you looked at a before map, where would you put the freeway?

There's no place for it. There are buildings and farms everywhere. It does not fit.

Now look at any modern city with freeways everywhere. They took the land and made the freeway blowing up sides of mountains, destroying thousands of buildings and acres of farmland. The freeway was built.

Few people were consulted, certainly we didn't wait for consensus for each and every single person who was going to be affected. Now everyone, even many of its biggest critics, rides on that freeway.

Whether or not the freeway is a benefit is irrelevant. It was built even though people said negative things about it (see #1). 

We must have the same scope of persistance, vision, and courage that people like Robert Moses had. Though  unlike him, I doubt our son will die in a cycle track accident.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[First of all, thank-you for reading. I cherish each and every comment. 

Sometimes I get lonely and I appreciate the tiny bit of attention I get.

Comments are turned on here for my benefit. If I don't think your comment benefits me, I'll delete it without fully reading it.

If you wish to comment, think, first, will this benefit Fred. If not, put it on your own blog.

Recently, some people I love, spoke to me and told me some things which I won't share, but at the end of the day, we need to raise our game.

1. Feel free to contradict me, but post NEW ideas and FACTS. "Rights to the road" and other crap are not welcome here. If I dismissed it in a prior blog post, then why do I want to see it again.

Yes, I post a lot. So if you disagree with me, I probably all ready heard it, thought about it for a week and discussed it with some people, researched it to death, posted about it.

2. Please don't insult me. No name calling nor labeling. 

I don't (yet) have the world's smoothest tongue nor the world's best manners. However, I am not sorry to have insulted you. Nobody made you come over to a tiny, obscure blog and read it.

It's really not personal and becoming less personal by the day.

3. Don't tell me what to do. This pisses me off.

4. For the love of God, please post something original. 

5. Make your comment intelligible.I don't know if there's some kind of special school that VCers go to or what, but mostly I have no clue what they are talking about. 

Again, feel free to comment and thanks.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Party Cyclin'</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Of course, when the Unbound household goes to parties, it brings its cycling with it.

Not to say that we can't let down our hair, but cycling is childlike so it's all ready part of the fun.

Last weekend, we went to a few parties.

In the first one, I met a guy who has a Russian bicycle for which he has to carry all the tools because it has its own special bolts and so on. Another guy, a friend, asked me if I ever rode a Linus commuter. I had not, but I was happy that he was interested seeing as his other bicycle was not suited to commuting.

At the next party, there were more people who were cyclists who wanted to talk about cycling.

There were the usually pitfalls, that we now have the right answers for. 

The first one was the notion of cyclists breaking laws. For this, I mentioned that not only do I follow all traffic laws, but I go out of my way to yield to someone who is in more of a hurry than I am. I also mentioned that my biggest fear is not in getting hit by a car, but hurting someone else, and it makes me happier to know that at least there is minimal chance that I will hit anybody.

This seemed to satisfy them.

Then there was the blasted helmet debate. I am going to do another post on this, but it's not party material. For parties, we were just silent about it. There are the same things said over and over again about helmets: how people are stupid not to wear them and so on. We just let this play itself out. It seems that once the stuff is said, the clockwork mechanism winds itself down and there's nothing more to say. Thinking deeper about it, or disagreeing would just get people repeating the same stuff over and over again. Helmets aren't about facts, they are about feelings.

Finally, we asked them what they wanted.

There were some people who lived in Mira Mesa and loved it. They said it was very assessable to anything that they wanted and that they cycled because it was faster! What?

Cycling is faster in Mira Mesa than driving? There are almost no provisions for cycling at all.

In a dense city, cycling is the fastest way to get around, but in a car built suburb?

However, that's their story and we have to believe them.

The only thing that they really missed out on was cycling parking. They said that there were enough bike lanes and that they felt safe otherwise.

The only other thing was more direct routes in some cases. That's it.

Cycle parking is dirt cheap and the only people who oppose it are the No Way, No How crowd which are a tiny, but VOCAL minority of motorists who's families all got killed by bicycle and tricycle gangs and thus they hate anything that doesn't pollute forever.

Seriously, this was a HUGE wake up call the advocates above the eight. There are many, many easy battles to be won up there.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Out of the Feet of Babes</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[A  while back, I did a piece on how women were safer cyclists and that I could learn more from them.

Ever since then I have been asking myself, how would a woman make this safer, when I ride.

I have found that my rides are a little bit longer, but a lot more relaxing, and enjoyable.

However, there's always someone who's willing to shit on my parade.

In this case, I was given a Watchel study which showed that actually women were equal to men in accidents.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PANMgwhvFVw

Oops, that was the three card monte. Here's the study:

http://www.bicyclinglife.com/Library/riskfactors.htm

The first thing you will know is the strange green and blue theme that this site has. Reminds me of the Commodore 64 days for some reason.

I had forgotten that I had read the study until I saw the greenish hue. Then I realized I was going to get a bowl of BS.

However, there was one thing I didn't notice about this paper before. Read it, and see if you can find it.

OK, you are  back.

Note that I have seen this paper cited serveral times. Like I said, it refuted my notion of learning from women through the power of statistics.

However, did you ever stop to think that stats can give you more than knowledge and even more than boredom?

Yes, that's right, stats can make you laugh.

Realize that the purpose of this paper is to prove that sidewalk cycling is dangerous.

It sort of does that. I mean there's no thick line between "dangerous" and "not dangerous". Street riding has risk as does sidewalk riding.

But I have seen this paper cited to show me not to ride on the sidewalk.

Guess what else this paper proves?

It shows that being really young protects you the most.

That's right, being younger is one of the biggest things you can do to keep yourself safe from accidents.

From the study:

"The table shows that older bicyclists incur a risk of colliding with a motor vehicle 1.8 times as great as younger ones, and the difference is statistically significant (p&lt;0.01). The older bicy­clists have a higher risk in all six major sub­groups; in four the difference is significant.&quot;

That 1.8 number is important. Alan Wachtel is quoted, all over the internet, and other places, saying that sidewalk riding is more dangerous than street riding. He even has used this as evidence against things such as cycle tracks.

How come he didn&#039;t talk about the second finding? The risk of sidewalk riding vs. street riding is also 1.8!

Older people are more likely to be experienced and educated. How come they never talked about the dangers (1.8!!) of being old and cycling? 

Oh, we can &quot;explain&quot; aka dismiss without any new data, the findings. But the sidewalk findings stand and fall along with the age findings. You can&#039;t arbitrarily toss out data just because it doesn&#039;t &quot;make sense&quot; to you.

If you did that, you&#039;d never learn anything new.

You can toss out data, but it has to match certain criteria set AHEAD OF TIME. 

I wasn&#039;t there when they wrote this paper, but I am guessing that the initial data set showed that sidewalk cycling was safer than street riding.

In my experience, there are far less conflict points on the sidewalk. The only problem is intersections. All kids are taught to stop and watch at each intersection. Perhaps the adults forgot this important lesson? I see many adults walk right in front of my bike without looking. I always stop far in advance of them because I am riding slow enough to be safe, and it&#039;s no big deal. But still, I care about people, and I hope they are OK when that Prius or other batter car comes down their street. :(

My guess for the strange anomaly is due to Table 1.

If you look at Table 1, it clearly states that the percent accidents for sidewalks is 35 while roadway is 65. So there are about two times more accidents in the road.

However, since Wachtel &quot;knew&quot; aka was indoctrinated with VC nonsense, he wanted to prove the opposite. So he further &quot;examined&quot; the data. I noticed that these people only look more closely at data that proves their point.

It&#039;s been several months, and the fake data which is off by 10x is still on door zone on wikipedia even though the link with correct data is there. So much for fact checking. :)

I feel that Watchel decided to break down the data into two groups so he could make the street look safer.

He succeeded just like the guy above took everyone&#039;s money.

Just like the House, Watchel and Co win every time.

After all, they make the rules. 

If it were up to me, I'd just publish Table 1. 

I have no animosity for Wachtel et al. They remind me of the Clash song, "The Card Cheat":

"There's a solitary man crying, "Hold me."
It's only because he's a-lonely
If the keeper of time runs slowly
He won't be alive for long!

If he only had time to tell of all of the things he planned
With a card up his sleeve, what would he achieve?
It means nothing!"]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I have covered things such as the helmet debate, taking the lane, whether or not the door zone is the death zone or it's all a bunch of propaganda and so on for a long time.

Long time readers know that in many of these cases, my mind is made up.

I feel like this is a really good thing.

At a certain point, we have to live our lives.

We can't be in an uncertain state forever; endlessly debating with ourselves (and others) whether or not we ought to wear a helmet or precisely how far away from parked cars should we ride.

Shit, if I hadn't messed up my head with a surfing accident, I'd be out riding right now. That's right, suck on it helmet wears! I didn't see a single person whining to me about helmet use even though I totally busted my head open when it got hit by a surfboard. That's because helmet wearing, in the US, is a cultural habit, but it's not necessary for safety.

Instead of picking open old wounds, I really like to see a few things.

First of all, who are all these people who make blanket assertions without evidence?

Again, places where helmets are not common are SAFER. I'm not here to build a house, but to find out why people are living here, metaphorically. Why of why do people ignore the evidence?

Second, in many cases there's ambiguous evidence. When this is the case, why do people cherry pick one set of studies over another.

I am sincerely scratching my head.

I have no idea why people do this.

My go to answer is that people are fucking stupid but because of the notion of a blog 2.0 with more compassion and empathy, I can no longer walk that road.

So, why is it that people choose these things.

I have a few guesses.

First, is to protect one's ego. 

This means that the longer you have been on a bike riding in a certain way, the more immune you are to learning and new information. This means that in many ways, "experience" is actually a bad thing because the most experienced are the most entrenched in their ideas, right or wrong. This is a very serious problem where we value authority of "experts" over more recent studies and data.

I have found that the urge to protect one's ego as being an impediment for learning is true a great deal of the time. Think about a time where your ego was threatened. Be honest. I don't want to know what it is, this is for you only. Now think about when you disagree with something in the bicycle world. Is the feeling the same? If so, your ego it threated.

Don't worry, I spend a great of time defending my own ego. I suffer along with my readers.

Second, people resist new ideas because there is a well known cognitive bias where people believe the first data that they get. Like everything with humans, this is not always true. However, more often than not, it is.

This is why people often have the religion of their parents. If they were told that there were many gods, the notion of one tiny god seems to be just wrong. And so on.

Thus, if you were told, as a kid, to wear a helmet, you might believe it your whole life without checking to see if there are any studies to prove it.

If you do read a study, you'll be searching for something to confirm that they help. If you don't find it, you'll search for a single error in the study.

"Aha," you conclude. "This single graph is wrong. We can safely dismiss this entire paper--even stuff that's not related to that single graph."

This is how I see grown people reasoning all the time.

Finally, there's fear. This means that if one has to change their views, there's this vague chasm of uncertainty.

This is uncomfortable for many people.Insteadd of dealing with this, I have seen people back away from the chasm. Then, haha, they accuse me of fear. Sweet projection is one of my favorite things.

Yes, I am afraid. You win.

However, my own fears, and those of others, do not determine the facts, unless those facts are about whatfrailtyy cats we all are. All of us.

I find fear to be quite a useful emotion for efficiently keeping my attention and thus I don't wish to be rid of it. However, I do think that fear should be appropriate.

Fear of new ideas is not useful and it's not appropriate. So cut it out and look inside. Is there some fear with a new idea?

Perhaps taking the lane is more dangerous than one supposed. Perhaps it's not.

Who knows.

I am bored of such tiny questions. 

I'm more interested in why you picked one piece ofambiguouss information and now you cling to it and attack others for heresy over an equally plausible yet alsoambiguouss piece of evidence.

Why o' why?

When I haveambiguityy, I just say I don't know. Hardly the words of an xpert, I know. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Speed Limit Biases?</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Here I am going to cover a really terrible study to try to boil down why this is terrible reasoning.

I ran into this study after reading a blog post. [I forget the post, if you know where this is, I'd love to give you credit.]

Basically, the blogger was talking about how the city wanted to raise the speed limit based upon a twenty year old paper: http://www.ibiblio.org/rdu/sl-irrel.html: Effects of Raising and Lowering Speed Limits by U.S. Department of Transportation      Research, Development, and Technology
Federal Highway Administration Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center 6300 Georgetown Pike McLean, Virginia 22101-2296.

Since I have had success in the past with reading papers and interpreting my own way, I thought that I'd give this one a shot.

Turns out, that, to quote an old friend, "this paper confirmed everything I had been saying all along." :)

Just kidding.

Actually, this paper is a little better than tautology.

First of all, the paper wants to look into two problems: people who speed and the accidents that they cause.

Both of these things are not problems to cyclists.

I realize that this may surprise you.

While fast moving traffic is worse for cyclists, by "speeding" the authors meant that "motorists who drive faster than the posted speed limit."

To paraphrase another old friend, "Cyclists are dyin', you know why! The speed limits are too damned high!"

Joking aside, in the past year alone, many of the cyclists and motorists who were involved in fatal collisions this year in San Diego were FOLLOWING ALL THE TRAFFIC LAWS. That's right, FOLLOWING THE TRAFFIC LAWS DOES NOT PROTECT ONE FROM GETTING INTO FATAL COLLISIONS.

Thus, the whole notion of speeding is idiotic because it only addresses a fake made up problem.

The way to calm traffic is to tame the street: narrow the lanes, add more stops, encourage pedestrians and cyclists, and for the love of god stop persecuting jay walkers and wrong way cyclists. Calmer traffic == less major injuries and fatalities.

But, no, this paper wants to set it up as a "compliance" problem as if the government is burdening the poor motorist too much by asking her to SLOW THE FUCK DOWN. 

But the madness continues!

The second problem this fine paper addresses is the problem of accidents.

Again, "accidents" are not the problem.

Pain is a teacher. We all need to fall down to learn. Part of the problem with motoring is that it doesn't allow you to bump into someone and get hurt and learn something. Collisions are either mitigated in the motorist's favor via clearing the roadside, guard rails, air bags, crumple zones and so on or they are totally deadly. No chance to learn in either case because there's no physical pain.

I got hit in the head by a surfboard last weekend. Guess who's signing up for a crash coarse (no pun intended) in surf board control?

The problem for cyclists are collisions with high speed motor vehicles. Again, this paper does NOTHING to address this problem at all. They are merely talking about collisions between two motor vehicles, only.

So if someone raises this paper in a meeting where they claim that it suggests that accidents can be mitigated by increasing the speed limit, mention that no it does not. It says that it will protect scofflaw motorists from legal repercussions by changing the law to the law breakers failure. I mean, we don't solve the murder problem by legalizing certain forms of murder do we? If there's a good reason for society for people to slow down on a road why are we ignoring that?

Second, this paper does NOT ADDRESS CYCLISTS AND PEDESTRIANS. Therefore, it is useless when referring to pedestrians and cyclists. In fact, I'd argue that it puts them at greater risk, and it even admits it in its round about way:

"A review of early vehicles speed legislation in the United States suggests that regulations were established to improve public safety.[1] The rational for government regulation of speed is based on the fact that unreasonable speed may cause damage and injury."

Here's a great quote, the kind I had expected. 

Note that this quote is NOT found in the summary nor to the people who present this paper know about it:

"The analysis further indicates that injury accidents increased irrespective of whether the speed limits were raised or lowered. Because the number of accidents at the comparison sites was less than 240 in the before and after period, injury accident estimates were based on the before and after analysis which does not control for nonrandom factors that can affect the results. Consequently, the accident estimates for injury accidents should be treated with caution. This precaution is also applicable to the results for the other groups listed in table 10 where the safety effects were estimated with the before and after method. "

We put things in all caps for those who are merely scanning for things to argue about or for data to back up their prejudices:

"INJURY ACCIDENTS INCREASED IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THE SPEED LIMITS WERE RAISED OR LOWERED"

Thus, it lowering speed limits didn't have a big increase in accidents. However, the SEVERITY of accidents where people drive slower does go down.

However, they mostly do NOT drive slower when the speed limit is lowered.

The paper mentioned elsewhere that with a lower speed limit the number of scofflaw motorists increased to over fifty percent. Thus according to this paper: FIFTY PERCENT OF MOTORISTS (OR MORE) ARE SCOFFLAWS.

When these people get on bicycles, do we expect them to follow all traffic laws? No. Thus, the whole notion of scofflaw cycling as being separate from scofflaw motorists is bunk. A scofflaw is a scofflaw, it doesn't matter what they are riding or driving.

Conclusions. 

First this paper is a piece of shit propaganda. Second, this paper can be used against those who wrote it by reading it carefully.

Thus, you should print out this paper, highlight the relevant parts and bring it to the next meeting so the next time someone misquotes this mess, you have your quotes ready too.

You're welcome.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[For the first time in a long time, yesterday, my head was almost completely empty for my entire ride.

Ever since I started my new job, my head had been abuzz with various things: not dying due to the commute sucking, trying to recall all my old network security tricks to impress my new bosses, fomulating come backs to people who said that cycling was dangerous, and much more.

Finally, this is all gone.

Long time readers know that I chant and meditate to take away the negativity, but yesterday, it was enough to just enjoy the white noise of the gentle roar of traffic around me.

While riding, the tiny part of my mind that was still sparking an occasional thought said, "I want every ride to be like this."

For a few times in the past it was.

My first really great ride was with Princess while we did Valley Forge Rides for fun. After a particularly tranquil and empty headed ride, Princess wanted this to last forever so we did our bicycle trip to Texas.

This trip was good in that we learned a lot and we did enjoy ourselves.

But each day was not an excercise in serenity. It was more like an excercise in frustration in many ways.

Now, for some reason, my mind is letting me relax once again, and I'm happy for it.

  <title>Bike To Work Day 2012</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Although we joked about renting a pink hummer to bike to work, today, we didn't have anything sinister planned when my princess drove me in a rental to work.

There were many reasons for this from the notion that I needed to get some beer to work for a special night to the fact that I need to go to the hospital to get stitches out and it's a little bit easier in a car (though totally practical on a bike).

The ride was super fast and smooth as San Diego has given over most of it's best real estate and money into getting people around as energy inefficiently as possible.

Being someone who can really enjoy and indulgence, the ride was pure bliss.

There were a only a very few die hard cyclists, most of them looking like neon fish soft of hugging the gutter in a motionless kind of way.

Cyclist's outside rarely matches their insides. Inside I'm happy or something, but outside I look pathetic and in the way. (Yes, we know how we look.)

Anyway, now my biggest problem is little squares on my customer's software and the fact that I have no place to put things. I never realized that I had been using my basket for years to store things. Plus, the frame of the bicycle was used to hang my clothes. Now my office is kind of empty and sad looking.

I keep wondering where my bicycle is.

Que bike to work dia! :)

  <title>Red Light (and Stop Sign) Running: Pointless Timesuck</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/05/21/red-light-and-stop-sign-running-pointless-timesuck/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Overall, I love Mia, but I have to disagree with her in this one case:

http://momentummag.com/articles/street-cents:-the-mistake-of--ticketing-cyclists

As I said before, I follow all traffic laws. This does not mean that I never go through a red light. Sometimes, the sensor are broken and will never change. Ever. If you are driving a car and get to a broken light, what do you do? I do exactly that on my bicycle.

I do stop for all red lights, but I might not wait the several weeks for them to fix the light.

Still, I really hate these debates because they are distraction: http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/bike-blog/2012/may/18/iam-red-light-survey-cyclist?newsfeed=true.

I see this all the time, and I think that we should not take the bait. We should merely say that we follow the traffic laws (and do it).

No more talk of "momentum" or "fairness" or "scofflaw motorists" or the fact that "following traffic laws doesn't necessarily make one safe". These are all true, but pointless side paths that will only get us deeper into nonsensical, rhetorical muck.

This is the whole point of these comments, to side track discussion which provides political cover for hating on cyclists.

Meanwhile, there are many problems with infrastructure, and we are being trolled and baited into a lose/lose argument.

If we just own our following the laws, we can move on. 

Everytime I mention this simple fact, people shut up immediately and walk away. Fast.

By the way, I am NOT for preaching to other cyclists (other than my readers I guess) to follow the laws. I just follow them and ignore the rest. 

I have found that the less I care about what other people do, the calmer I am. This is probably why I have been having so many empty headed and relaxing rides lately.

As for the gas money which supposedly builds the roads the we freeload on, we should start a petition asking for the building of cycling infrastructure to come from the general tax fund. Game over.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I hate to write posts like this (or maybe not, why am I writing it), but this is another of my series of Annoying Advice Posts.

You may skip it, if you don't like annoying advice.

Basically, the premise of this advice is based on the fact that many people discriminate against cyclists. 

My initial reaction to this is to hide your bicycle.

We'll eventually change the prejudice's of the world, but in the meantime, we don't want to miss out on the good things in life.

Thus, if you get harassed by a driver, let them assume you are driving when you call the cops.

When you are assaulted while on your bike, let the police assume that the police did it with their hands. Don't mention a bicycle.

And so on.

For a job interview. 

HIDE YOUR BICYCLE.

Let them assume that you drive.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>_Why Cycling</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I think that I need to start a new category called people or something.

Anyway, one of my newest favorite influences in the advocacy world is _Why, who, like me, is not even a cycling advocate. That's right, I'm not actually an advocate because I have not really done anything. I do support the bike advocacy system, however, and I root for them. I'm just not an advocate myself.

Anyway, _Why is (or was) a Ruby programmer who was very inspirational for a whole group of programmers.

He had the knack of making programming really, really exciting.

Then, suddenly, he vanished from advocacy forever.

Overall, I totally agree with this move as he needs to take care of himself, and he gave us so much. Also, some big time jerks had posted way too much info about him, and he's a private guy.

However, there still is a great deal of material about him online (google it).

Anyway, here's a little taste of _Why:

"I admire programmers who take risks.  
They aren’t afraid to write dangerous or “crappy” code.  
If you worry too much about being clean and tidy, you can’t push the boundaries.  
(I don’t think!)  
I also admire programmers who refuse to stick with one idea about the “way the world is.”  
These programmers ignore protocol and procedure.  
I really like Autrijus Tang because he embraces all languages and all procedures.  
There is no wrong way in his world."

You could say the same thing with cycling infrastructure. 

Instead of greeting something new with fear, we could greet it with a celebration. Just like _Why has shown us.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This morning, I had a great ride into work as I usually do.

Yes, I am still taking the "Balls Out" route down Fairmount.

On the other hand, I am trying to focus on the positive.

This morning there were at least two pluses that made my day.

First of all, there was the smell of honeysuckle while I rode by the garden next to the grocery store. Yum.

Next was the freeway hum, which by the grocery store sounds almost exactly like it did in my meditation room in South Philly, which is my happy place.

Thus, smelling that smell and listening to that sound put me into my happy place while I peddled up that steep, steep hill.

When I got to the corner, there was even a walk sign because a pedestrian had all ready pushed it.

A great morning, today.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Sustainable Safety: Cycling Homogeneity</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[We all know that I can talk about <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CFQQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sustainablesafety.nl%2FRegio%2FChris%2520Schoon_UK.pdf&amp;ei=6Hm-T7_QKKzKiALg1ZioDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHCwFkH9i1yRJn2buIPrhZJvd3djw&amp;sig2=J0WfNaE3SquF_1crLu0dGA">Sustainable Safety (pdf)</a> all day. 

So I will.

One of the principles is "homogeneity of masses and/of speed and direction."

In plain English this means that we should keep all the big and fast vehicles together as well as all the slow and small ones.

The end result is safety, efficiency, and comfort.

I know that this sounds like common sense, but there are many people who miss out on this one.

Both of these come from my hero, <a href="http://bikinginla.wordpress.com/2012/05/24/a-little-this-a-little-that-a-little-bike-courtesy-goes-a-long-way-nimby-homeowners-battle-expo-bikeway/">at BikingLA</a>.

The first one was a <a href="http://www.woodtv.com/dpp/news/local/kent_county/Kenowa-Hills-bike-ride">prank</a> where some high school seniors rode their bicycles to school.

We are going back and forth about whether they should have been punished or not. The most messed up thing is that we are missing the bigger issue on the problems that it caused.

Here we have sixty cyclists who "took the lane". It ended up pissing some people off including the principle. I have some sympathy for her because she wants to run a school and sixty cyclists really gummed things up.

This is one reason why I suggest to NOT take the lane. Ride in the door zone or side walk to let traffic through. I have no illusions that we can change people's minds about cycling, but at the same time, do we have to hurt people for no reason? No.

Plus, they said it was a prank which set the frame for them getting punished.

I think that cycling should be a normal part of a school kids experience and not a "prank". But if it is, we have to look into whether we should accommodate them. I suggest a cycle track.

Now they are talking about her losing her job. Really not worth some VC nonsense style pranks.

Second we have the problem of cyclists "buzzing" others who use a multi-use path. Again, the problem is not addressed at all which is that a multi-use path is not suitable for training at high speeds. We need to go slower on these things. 

I have been saying this for years, a multi-use path is great, but it's NOT cycling infrastructure. We need our own separate locations with NO dog walkers. This means building a separate path for dog walkers.

Building two paths instead of one will save a lot of money because it will accommodate far more people who will save thousands on car payments (see my post on cycling getting us into the middle class).

Anyway, the point is that a multi-use path costs should not count as money spent on cycling. This is why I say that they spend NO money on cycling in San Diego. It's ALL shared space.

I can ride just fine on a multi-use path. I slow down for the dogs and the moms with their strollers. I'll walk my bike to make people not feel threatened. But again this is not an ideal situation, and I'm all about things getting better forever.

The take home message is that if we want to really spend our tax dollars efficiently, we need to make some bicycle only infrastructure which is modified for higher speed cyclists, preferably one way. That way we can accommodate these road users.

So here's a puzzler: ":As a friend of mine said, if enough people take the lane, what's different about taking the lane and making it a permanent cycle track?*" (Answer at bottom).

I'm glad the seniors rode to school ONE TIME IN THEIR WHOLE LIVES. It would have been better for their health and the local economy, however, if they had build a cycle track so they could ride daily.

* Answer to puzzler: Nothing.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Here's a quote from John Allen:

"Yes, getting rear-ended on rural roads is a major cause of fatalities. It is not the major cause of fatalities in urban areas."

Note how broad these sentences are. They give no time period, they don't define urban and rural and they act as if all rural areas are similar to all other rural areas.

This is almost total nonsense because it's too vague to be true in all cases.

However, he still does understand that there is a big risk on rural roads in general.

From his original study:

"...no doubt that the likelihod of sustaining fatal injuries is greater for accidents that occur in rural areas."

Also, read the type 13 accident from the Cross study, and please no more VC nonsense.

Let's not equate things, but give facts.

"Bike are traffic" is a meaningless phrase because it sets two things equal to another, but tells us nothing about the real world.

1. People were inconvenienced thus cementing in people's minds that bikes create trouble for roadway users. In this case, they created unnecessary delays.

2. Rural roads* are deadly for riding. 

3. Shoulder riding is much safer.

* See Cross for definitions.]]></wp:comment_content>

Many "take the laners" remove rural roads deaths from their data.

We all agree, no shoulder is a deadlier road. That's a fact.

  <title>Cycling Bullying: Possible Motivations?</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/05/29/cycling-bullying-possible-motivations/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[One thing that I have been obsessed with lately has been bullying.

For me, roadway bullying in the form of taunts and buzzing have been a very small part of cycling.

However, sometimes it's the briefest of interactions that stick in your minds the most. Certainly, a motorist having a bad day can ruin my day in a short time.

After recent experiments where I found that the threat of 10 lbs of steel can scare off a few tons, I wondered, "Are there really this many shitty people in the world?"

Since I crave a life where I live in a happy bubble, I really didn't want to know. I still don't know if I can take it.

Then, however, I realized that I all ready had a mild case of Stockholm Syndrome. I felt that bullying came with the territory.

This is like women in the sixties who felt that a little groping came with their office job, I guess.

Not that my life is as bad as anyone who's sexually harassed. I am trying to come up with the sanest and best analogies. I realize that I can get a car and be done with it--or can I? 

Not really, when googling for roadway bullying, I have read more than one account where a motorist has been beaten by another for "cutting him off" or some other motorist nonsense of which I am blissfully unaware.

No, the reason I was googling because one day the light went on in my head, and I realized that the bad behavior we tolerate of motorists--I didn't see him--has exact parallels with the other empty excuse: "boys will be boys."

Boys will always be boys, but they don't have to be rapists nor do motorists have to pose as killers.

In fact, I was working on a layman's assessment of the legal rights of cyclists when faced with dangerous and unjust behavior at the hands of roadway bullies. I'll write more on this later.

For now, I just wanted to link to this splendid post:

http://streetsblog.net/2012/05/17/ladyblogs-bully-free-zone-doesnt-apply-to-cyclists/

"...why do people find jerk bicyclists so harmful to society when they constantly interact with motorists who run red lights and stop signs... and engage in other dangerous behaviors that kill people every day?

.... I think it’s also because we’ve trained ourselves to think of driving as passing through an obstacle course rather than moving through a social space. Cars that do dumb stuff are a nuisance, but they do not interrupt the illusion until there’s an actual crash. Bodies that do dumb stuff are a threat to the idea that driving is a no harm, no foul activity."
This was backed up by a UK study that said that one of the biggest fears that motorists have is that they are going to hit a cyclist.

Long time readers know that we are all motivated by a strong urge to protect our own egos. Therefore, we are not about to say, "Oops, I am risking people's lives, I should be more careful."

No, we'd rather say, "It's the cyclists fault for being so vulnerable in the first place. If they weren't there in the street, the I couldn't hit him."

This is one of the many reasons I like to constantly point out that the number of cycling deaths in the US--while pointless and ought to be reduced--pale in proportion to motorist's deaths. I usually say, "You are more likely to DIE INSIDE A CAR than outside."
Usually I am met with all sorts of noise on stats, but the point is that if more people are dying at something then we can all agree that it's more deadly--this is tautalogy. Perhaps it's not as deadly in a statistical sense, but it kills more people, and that has to count for something.

The reason I point this out is that sometimes people suggest that I am putting myself out by cycling too much and I ought to get around some other way.

I will!

Here's the deal: give me a way to get around that is more harmless than a bicycle aka pollutes less and kills less victims (cyclists kill about one person a year), kills less people than 33,000 a year, costs less than cycling, provides better excercise than cycling, is less annoying to others, and is quieter on cycling while it gets me around faster than cycling. 

Any takers? Until then, I'll ride around on a terrible way of getting around: cycling. It's awful, but less awful than the alternatives.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Fears About Cycling Bullying</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[For a long time, I thought that my role was to say nice things about cycling in a world where people want to equate riding a bicycle for transportation as death. 

I _still_ want to do this, however, I have other goals, too.

On of them is talking about things that nobody else wants to talk about.

Cycling bullying is hard to talk about for many reasons, and it brings up many of my fears.

My biggest fear is my reputation. I don't want people to think that I have no sense of humor.

Second, I don't wish people to think that I'm a whiner. I don't want to be known as that "bitchy cycling fred". :)

Finally, I don't want to be seen as "playing the victim" because I'm not a victim; I'm a victor. Any kind of bullshit harassment or abuse (which does not really happen) only can make my victory that much sweeter.

My self image is the guy who is in hell who is whistling while one demon whispers to another, "we're not reaching this guy."

On the other hand, roadway bullying is NOT going to go away. The police don't care, in fact, later on, I'll write how I feel that they are actually complicit in deadly roadway behavior.

Politicians are NOT going to fix the problem. They have not done much save for a few places like LA.

Most bicycle advocates are NOT going to fix the problem, either. In the VC world, acknowledging roadway bullying means admitting that the roads are NOT perfect as is and that a bicycle is the exact same as a car. This means that their classes will NOT make you safe which means that they have no purpose in life.

So how to make us safe from roadway bullying? I think that first, we need to define what bullying is, and what tools are available to stopping it. Then we can actually get on with fixing it.

For now, I'd like to break my code of silence and admit that while it does not happen often, it ruins a morning despite my meditation and other happy thoughts.

Second, it does make me not want to ride on a road which pisses me off because if they force you off the road then they win.

I'm not fighting for fighting for the Right to the Road, but rather to make routes shorter and safer by applying sane principles such as homogeneity. However, I do get angry when bad behavior is rewarded.

Finally, I do believe that through bad jokes, Hollywood mockery, online comments and more, there is an atmosphere that is created that makes hurting cyclist OK, even fun and funny.

This is no coincidence.

People respond to their environments including the culture that they swim in.

I am determined to see this culture change in my lifetime.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Cycle Bullying: With Malice Towards None</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/05/31/cycle-bullying-with-malice-towards-none/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, I have spoken about cycle bullies and the culture that causes it.

One might think that I am mad at the world; I'm not.

One of my goals in life it to finally overcome anger, and I'm getting there, though not as fast as I'd like, of course.

I really do believe in "turning the other cheek".

On the other hand, like I said before, I'd like to make my world better on the inside and outside. Thus it's important to get bad motorists out of their vehicles  because it's not just about my internal state.

Overall, for me, it's been a challenging balancing act, but just knowing that I'm not alone in this, and that the distinction between the my outside world and inside is mental and arbitrary motivated me to think more about my own environment.

Overall, my premise is that ALL people are good including malicious motorists and the indifferent government employees who claim helplessness to help cyclists all the while attacking cyclists both via selfish and deadly infrastructure decisions and their lack of legal knowledge and research.

My goal is to forgive and to love them all. 

However, it would be disrespectful to cyclists to stop the research. I have no illusions that this will be super-useful in helping people, but it is a hobby of mine so I'll continue my daily, five minute, google breaks to find out how the law can help make the streets just as safe for cyclists as motorists, by spending billions of tax dollars from the general fund, paid by motorists and non-motorists alike, have done for themselves.

Thus, I'll continue to quote this beautiful poem of Buddha:

"For hatred does not cease by hatred; hatred ceases by love.
The world does not know that we must all come to an end here;
but those who know it, their quarrels cease at once."]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, Jim, asked what he thought that the community could do to make cycling better. Brilliant question!

Here are some things.

Things to Stop Now:

1. Stop calling yourself an expert and forget all you know. Question all your thoughts as if they were from a stranger.

2. Renounce VCism and all of its tenets. 

3. Burn your copies of Effective Cycling and Cycle Craft. Toss out your LCI and stop putting these titles after your name. For now on, you are citizen not LCI.

4. Burn your lycra, helmets, yellow safety vests and other affects that suggests that cycling is akin to that of a construction worker. From now on, wear the same clothes on a bicycle as you would in your car.

5. Get rid of your car and ride your bicycle everywhere.

6. Forget the idea that you have things to teach. You are here to listen now. Don't correct others on their cycling style. 

Things to Commit to:

1. Listen to the community. Talk to homeless people, minorities, women, children and more all over San Diego. Spend the most time speaking with those who want to cycle, but say that it cant'. Write down all the things that they want and advocate for that.

2. If it's cycling related advocate for it. If you're not sure it's a good idea, say nothing. Let the lawyers lawyer and the engineers engineer. Your job is to speak in favor of things, or if you can't remain silent.

3. Commit to and immediately recruit fifty percent women and minorities to the CABO board. Until this is done, suspend all further activities.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Bully Cycling: The Mind of a Bully</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/06/06/bully-cycling-the-mind-of-a-bully/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Bully Cycling: The Mind of a Bully

I can't cover everything, but here's a few things I have learned.

First of all, many people see bullying as a sign of low self-esteem.

This because self-esteem training is our modern psychological panacea.

Recent data, however, shows that bullies don't feel bad about themselves, they think that they are better than others aka too high of a self-esteem. 

How many times do you hear motorist bullies talk about cyclists who "slow them down." This presupposes that their time is more valuable than others.

It explains why they will buzz you then slow down to at a crack in the road as to not damage the bottom of their cars. Imagine their car is more important than your body! Not the thinking of a sufferer of low self-esteem.

They justify their aggression because cyclist were "in their way". As if they, only, had a mystical "way" that needs to be protected by naked force.

http://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/07/science/the-bully-new-research-depicts-a-paranoid-lifelong-loser.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm

"Rapidly accumulating research on the psychology of bullies also shows that the belligerence of these youngsters arises not just from nastiness, but also from a perceptual bias that leads them to see - and retaliate against - threats where none exist.

''Bullies see the world with a paranoid's eye,'' said Kenneth Dodge, a psychologist at Vanderbilt University. ''They feel justified in retaliating for what are actually imaginary harms.''

Thus, words like, "war on motorists" is not just histrionic drivel, but it's actually an indicator of something more sinister.

If a bike lane is a "war on motorists" what power and license does that give motorists to "protect themselves and their families"?

I feel that people who use such language should be called out for what they really are. They are bullies who have a distorted view of the world. They should be stopped before they kill again.

''We find that bullies have a strong need to control others,'' said John Lochman, a psychologist at Duke University Medical School. ''Their need to be dominant masks an underlying fear that they are not in control, and they mask the sense of inadequacy by being a bully.''

Again, when people, in their cars start bossing you around, this is a sign of bullying behavior.

But it gets worse:

http://www.realpsychology.com/content/gps-parents-and-teachers/how-are-bullies-created

"When given the chance to assert power over someone else many people will become sadistic. There are a few who have a strong sense of empathy, and an internal compass to guide them towards altruistic and normal behavior. However, the Stanford Prison Experiment examines how quickly groups can deteriorate into bully behavior."

Imagine giving each bully a tank where they can enforce their will on others and a means where they feel that they can get away with impunity after causing harm. What kind of behavior do you expect.

Thus, I am not shocked that cyclists are killed daily. My only real surprise is that far fewer of us die to these horrible roadway bullies.

However, before we try to demonize all motorists, I suggest that we clean house first.

Thus, this blog appologizes on behalf of all cyclists everywhere for any harm that we caused while riding to any motorist. I especially feel bad for those who attack cars when they are stuck in traffic.

However, let's keep things in perspective. The harm caused by cycling fools who run lights or who block cars with their bikes pales in contrast to the hundreds of deaths that cyclists have at the hands of roadway bullies.

Let's have some compassion for everyone.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Blind Driving Considered Illegal</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Long time readers probably know that I have animosity towards none, but sometimes, we have to use tough love.

In this case, it's Blind Drivers.  

Never heard of them, you say.

That's because I just made up the term. It bothers some people when I do that, but I call it "original thought"--yet another phrase I'm taking credit for. :)

By blind, I don't mean seeing impaired. I never had any problems with the seeing impaired at all.

What I mean is people who deliberately drive while they can't see.

This should be obvious, but I find that nearly ALL of my insanely controversial ideas are just plain old common sense that shouldn't even be addressed.

In fact, I think that the Land of the Obvious is the cutting edge, where all the real action is at.

Again, I'll say it again IF YOU CAN'T SEE, EVEN FOR A MOMENT, STOP YOUR FUCKING CAR AND PUT ON FOUR WAY FLASHERS.

"But what if I get rear-ended," one might ask.

No fear of that UNLESS THERE ARE MORE BLIND DRIVERS ON THE ROADS.

So, duh, let's get all the blind drivers off the road.

My notion is that is someone says IDSYM, "I didn't see you, mate," their car is automatically impounded and they lose their license for a year, do not pass go, do not collect $200.

Why?

Because, I THINK THAT DRIVING A CAR WHEN YOU CAN'T SEE SHOULD BE ILLEGAL.

How many times did people hit things that they _could_ see? If they do, then, sometimes, if they police _believe_ that they might be able to press charges, they will charge a motorist with assault and many other things.

If they didn't see someone, currently, this is a get out of jail free card.

Why is this so? Shouldn't we ban dangerous behaviors?

Why the hell are we banning cell phone use if we don't, indirectly, care about blind  driving?

You know I'm OK with cell phone use, but not blind driving. You can text at a red light. You can dial before you start driving. I don't think that having a cell phone in your hand is a crime. I do think that taking your eyes off the road is.

Imagine how many motorists and children of motorists will be saved?

Imagine a world where people are NOT in deadly fear of all other humans who chose to encase themselves in metal and steel?

Imagine lower insurance rates and less hospital visits. Now the police can use their very, very strained resources to go after child molesters instead of wasting their time writing tickets for cell phone possession and other nonsense.

Can anyone seriously suggest that we should keep Blind Driving legal?]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Long time readers know that at the end of each year I nominate the VC city of the year.

This is a city where Vehicular Cycling is most successful in squashing safety measures because of their bizzaro world and racist world view that this is "segregation" and "discrimination" (sic).

Obviously, Orlando usually wins as Florida, overall, is most deadly due to badly thought out--though legal and following code--design.

Now they wish to lose their title:

http://transportationnation.org/2012/06/04/orlando-launches-pedestrian-safety-campaign/

Watch out VCers. Or should they?

Let's see.

From the article:

"She says drivers and pedestrians both have to change their behavior to bring down the accident rate."

This is totally wrong!

People don't just "decide to change their behavior" on a massive basis. People like the familiar and follow old habits.

If they are this lame at simple psychology, I wonder what else they are missing!

Secondly, the whole onus on pedestrians is totally wrong. Pedestrians--while left alone--hurt almost nobody unless they punch them in the face. :)

However, most cities restrict pedestrians greatly. Autos take up almost 100% of the travelway as to cross a street, you have to walk all the way to the end of a block. Similar restricts are NOT found on autos which are much faster anyway.

The ONLY thing that makes walking dangerous is that they are forced to "mix with cars" which is a totally stupid idea.

"With about 730 pedestrian injuries and 45 deaths a year, Orlando has some way to go."

But fuck pedestrians, let's blame them for their deaths. Great job Orlando! :)

"But Mighk Wilson, MetroPlan Orlando’s Smart Growth Planner, says bringing the rate down by 10 per cent a year can be done."

I have read his stats on bicycle deaths, and most of the texts puts the blame on the cyclists so I doubt that he'll have much luck unless he greatly restricts cycling and walking. The Savvy Cycling which is a rebooting of Forester's useless class hasn't had much effect on mode share nor saftey compared with NYC's much less expensive and easier to maintain infrastructure which has saved many lives and has gotten many people on bicycles.

“It certainly is ambitious, but it is doable. Fatalities are really tough to deal with,” says Wilson. "Reducing crashes as a whole has to be more of the strategy.”

Notice that he's all ready moving the goal post which is a common VC stunt. He has all ready done everything but give up on fatalities before he has started. Great job!

"Wilson says one design fix will be to increase street lighting, although that can be expensive."

I love this. Every time there's a fix, it's "expensive". We never ask what the whole cost of the roads that are killing people in the first place costs. Compare this cost to the price of fuckin' street lights, something that every ghetto has in Philadelphia, and you see what a bargain it is.

"“Having a refuge in the middle of a roadway greatly improves safety for pedestrians,” says Wilson."

What! This is a bad, bad sigh. This means that the roads are so huge that they have can't even walk across safely!

What a hot mess, reminds me of my commute. Instead of slowing down traffic and pulling out lanes, they'll mitigate the tiny problems that pedestrians cause. It's like the harmless people who walk have to stop bothering those virtuous automobiles by "getting out of the way faster".

Lame!

"Ultimately, he says, a lot of the responsibility for preventing crashes falls on drivers."

Based on this, I predict total failure. If drivers cared to prevent crashes, he would not have been called in to do this job. So the whole thing is backwards.

There's more:

“What we’ve forgotten as a culture is that there are crosswalks at every intersection, whether they’re marked or not,” he says."

Here we get deeped into VC nonsense. "Unmarked crosswalks"? There's no such thing. This is imaginary. 

“While it’s true that many crashes involve a pedestrian who’s crossing mid block and doesn’t yield to traffic in the roadway, they could walk fifty feet over to the nearest intersection and cross in an unmarked crosswalk, but no one’s going to recognize that crosswalk.”

Here he goes again. For a second he said that driver's were responsible which was a tiny, but good start, then he flip flops back to blaming pedestrians. This is a man who clearly does not walk much. His plan make things even more inconvenient to make motoring easier. Great job! :)

"So the coalition will also focus on educating pedestrians to use crosswalks, and letting drivers know Florida’s law requires them to yield to pedestrians in crosswalks."

This pisses me off. Motorists should be prepared to stop at any time. If there are no cross walks, a motorist will NOT recognize it. Again, if common human behavior especially motorist behavior from another motorist is not factored in, we have a complete fail.

“The best way we probably can change the behavior of pedestrians and drivers is to ensure that we have appropriate enforcement.”

Again, this is a totally failing idea because it's way, way, more expensive to ensure that each and every motorist gets a ticket for every infraction rather than building facilities that naturally guides one in making better decisions.

In fact, I predict that motorists will continue to disobey traffic laws and even kill pedestrians with impunity.

"Meanwhile the city of Orlando is also trying to make the environment safer for pedestrians. Currently it’s halfway through a 4 million dollar, federally funded program to add 18 miles of sidewalks to city streets."

Finally, a good idea. However, I suggest that instead of building new sidewalks they just take over a lane and put up barriers which are less expensive.

"A study by Michigan's transportation department showed that high-tension cable guardrails cost about $15 per foot, while W-beam metal guardrails cost twice that and concrete barriers cost $80 per foot."

  <title>Education and Experience: Irrelevant to Safety?</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Long time readers know that I am a stubborn man who holds onto some deeply held beliefs for dear life.

For example, I honestly believe that my princess is the most beautiful woman on the planet. No experiment can dispute that.

Other beliefs include that the quiet, calm part of my commute ought to be increased at the public's expense until I can attain the second level jhana and hold onto it, while balancing on my bicycle, all the way from my house, to my job.

Other people, like this San Diegan:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cwk3v3dcAw

think that things must be as dangerous and as expensive as possible. I should have to encase myself in a paragon of modern engineering, paying out of my my hard earned pocket--you're not going to give me ten grand, are you, Jim--to buy a loaf of bread.


Still others think that classes make one safe.

However, there's a study that shows that perhaps education and experience are useless:

http://www.bicyclinglife.com/Library/riskfactors.htm

Yes, I have mocked this study before for proving that being a minor magically makes one safer on a bicycle.

This is still how things are, but there's more.

I can't get this study out of my mind, and the only conclusion I can come to about it is that perhaps I dismissed it too early, for a laugh, and what it really means much more.

That is, I feel that there are two human behaviors that put one at risk for getting hit by a car. One is cyclist's behavior and the other is motorist's behavior.

If you ride right into traffic which is going 80 MPH on the freeway, you are sure to die soon. But who does that?

In reality, most cyclists try to stay safe, and those who are out there for a little while might actually reach their peak safety.

This is because--note this is speculation--that motoring behavior is the limiting variable. A limiting variable is one which is so huge that it affects the entire system. Thus, you can tinker with all the other ones you want, but if you don't address the limiting variable, you do NOTHING to change a system.

I don't know that motorist behavior is this variable but I have some clues:

1. Cars are killing cyclists. If a cyclist doesn't kill himself, but still dies, he was probably hit by a car.

2. Society, on all levels is there to keep someone in their car, no matter how deadly they are. Thus, dangerous drivers are encouraged to drive.

3. There are very few cyclists and fewer die (thankfully) so it's hard to say much for sure with such a tiny dataset.

To summarize, if you ride all crazy, but motorists stop in time, you live.

In contrast, if you ride lawfully and according to some class, and one person is texting and doesn't see you, you die.

Thus, in our shitty system, there's not a lot you can do. You can die cycling due to no fault of your own.

Of course, there are those who disagree like this well meaning person, from my favorite city for cycling, Keri:

http://vimeo.com/43603867

The reason that I am so vehemently against all this is because it ignores these basic facts of life.

Remember, a split second of motoring by an "incompetent motorist" can wipe 90 years of competent cycling off the map. So we need a better way to protect ourselves.

Let's critique this video.

First of all, I really have no malice towards Keri. I think that she's a nice person, and as someone who primarily identifies as a pedestrian, I am happy to hear the nice things she said about us.

However, I do think that she has turned to the dark side of the force, and I feel that she will one day come around.

Come on Keri, join us! :)

From the talk:

1. Bicycling is inherently safe 

2. Safety is the product of behavior

Keri:

Either this contradicts #1 or we are all safe and can go home.

Next she suggests that the roads are set up in a way to go against all of our basic instincts for safety which she calls a "knowledge inversion."

But humans are evolved for maximal survival on the Earth's surface. But she acts as if the roads were an immutable result of a Martian plot.

In fact the roads were made by human hands.

ROADS WHICH MAKE CYCLING, BY INSTINCT, DANGEROUS ARE DANGEROUS AND NEED TO BE FIXED. A CLASS WILL NOT CHANGE BASIC INSTINCTS.

Just like someone who thinks that gay people can be "taught" to be ungay or that teens can be taught to be celebrate, she thinks that we can be taught to ignore millions of years of evolution because we lack "knowledge". 

I say that these roads are inherently unsafe if someone needs a degree or they will die.

Now she says that cyclists behave in an unsafe manner because they are not seen everyday and not seen as normal.

Wrong!

She has the inversion. Ask anyone and the reason that they don't ride for transportation is because they think it's unsafe. They don't ride in an "unsafe" manner because they feel that not abnormal, but  rather totally impossible to ride at all.

Next she says one of my favorite words, which is "counter-measure". This is a really stupid way of looking at things because it's all about hindsight. This is really bad because we have no crystal ball. Also, as usual, she is going to ignore the greater number of fatalities which I saw in most datasets, including the primordial study, the 1977 Cross study, that all this nonsense is based on.

If you realize that you are more likely to die in the travel lane, isn't it thick to say you should avoid the much safer door zone because you might win a "door prize" and skin your knee. I'll hold off on this as I covered this door zone lie in previous posts.

Next she moves on to disagreeing with the consensus. I have a lot of sympathy for her ideas: "streets are for people", however, our reality is what most people want. That is, if people mostly believe that streets are for cars, they'll lash out at you if you question that. To merely assert the opposite to a group of naive people is to do them a major disservice. I wonder if this opens one up to liability...

Next, to say that "streets are for cars, thus I don't have to stop for stop signs" is total nonsense and she's beginning to single out cyclists for attack, only. That is, most cyclists are motorists. Most motorists do NOT stop for stop signs.

Is it not a simpler notion to see that motorists take their scofflaw behavior with them when they ride bicycles? By singling out cyclists as a special group for scorn for behavior that is common to all, is she not doing to cyclists what she initially complained about: singling out cyclists because of unimportant differences.

Now she starts to complain about all kinds of things that cyclists do that annoy her. 

Instead of seeing all cyclists as human beings making normal responses to an unhealthy environment, she mocks them as if they were some lower form of life who need her superior intelligence.

Here's another dumb quote: "Cycling is dangerous and won't be safe until other people change."

This is a straw man argument. I believe that she, herself, has made a case that cycling is dangerous because our environment works against normal human behavior.

Quote: "We'll just stripe a bike lane through an interchange."

Haha, this is clearly a mistake.

I agree that I, too, don't want to ride through an interchange, but please just remember this quote for the future.

The slide about "manufactured conflict" is infuriating because she pretends to be completely ignorant that these problems have been solved. Yet when told about the solution, she mocks those people. Thus, I can see this as willful ignorance.

OK, then she puts up a slide that claims that the cities of America are addressing cyclist's needs through infrastructure. I have not seen a single city, not even Portland, that gives half the attention to cyclists as it does to motorists. And since motorists are the problem, giving them money to spend will only make things more dangerous. So this is a another straw man. My argument is that we are not even scratching the surface when it comes to the state meeting our needs. In fact, I have argued that the state is complicit in cycling deaths.

Then she told a story about how dangerous a bike lane is which is funny because I know a cyclist who rides VC and knows the law who experiences this every day WITHOUT A BIKE LANE!

Then she goes on to tell how VC can ride, safely and comfortably, anywhere. After this, of course, there's another contradiction where she tells how she can "exploit the lights to get from a fast street  to a quiet one". Why not just ride on fast streets all the time. 

Oh yeah, because it sucks. And what if you are stuck on busy roads only. Nobody rides VC in San Diego because it makes cycling suck as she just admitted.

Then she talks about communication and rewarding motorists which I totally agree with.

Then she says we must first "support vital behaviors."

No! I have no interest in "vital behavior" whatever that is. I have never heard anyone who wants that. I do want a feeling of safety, efficiency, and comfort.

Recall, earlier, where I said remember this? Now instead of saying, about an interchange, I don't want to ride there, she talks about teaching others to ride in dangerous intersections. Oh, yeah, she meant the one with paint on it.

Just as she mentioned that streets don't kill people, "they're pavement", paint, also, does not kill people. I knew this second, contradictory shoe would drop.

When we get to the "ultimate enactment" we see that Keri peer pressured someone to ride in an insane traffic situation, something I wouldn't do to my worst enemy.

This, to me, seems more and more like cultish behavior where a group pressures someone to do something that they normally would not do. 

Like cult members, when faced with overwhelming evidence that they acted foolishly and even put themselves in danger, many cult members lash out at their friends while blindly obeying their cult masters.

This ultimate enactment seems like a way of "sealing the deal." That is, when someone does something insane for another they come to the conclusion that they must love them otherwise, their behavior does not make any sense.

Now my level of hatred towards VCism has hit an all new high. They even talk about instilling "new beliefs" in someone.

Ug, if there were decent infrastructure, we wouldn't have to go rearranging our brains just to ride a bicycle. It would be eon with our own normal human beliefs and feelings.

OK, I'm tired, and I'll freely admit that VCers can totally exhaust me with blather.

Much of her infrastructure ideas, I actually agree with.

However, one thing that she doesn't note is that she is assuming that cyclists are second class citizens in most of her example because we are mitigating cyclists to cars rather than the opposite. I cover this in another post.

In my world, cycling as a first class activity, gets first class funding. Motor vehicles, since they are more deadly, less healthy, and not as accessible to all, like other junior partners should take a junior part of the budget. She sees motorists as more deserving of money and infrastructure than cyclists and we should accommodate cars by constantly "negotiating" with them rather than like normal, powerful people, sending others to negotiate one time and not worrying about stuff ever again.

Anyway, here's how I feel about all those complicted but ultimately meaningly charts and graphs:

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[One huge thing that makes myself and the Ninja Cycling Community different from the VC community and the rest of bicycle advocacy in general is that I don't really feel like my actions are that important.

That is, I don't feel like I can really do much to change how the world perceives cyclists.

For example, if I stop at every stop sign, and red light, I still get someone yelling to get out of the street. So I ride on sidewalk and piss off pedestrians. Or ride in a bike lane and get yelled at for appropriating motorist's gas money for my "hobby" (sic).

I'm not saying that the world sucks. My world is full of people who have souls of large fuzzy rainbows that dazzle my eyes with their beauty. I try to love everyone no matter how undeserving and shitty they are.

I'm just saying that I don't really care too much about how people see me. I mean, I care about my friends and how they view me, but in the greater world, I have chosen not to put a lot of energy into pleasing a world that can not and will not be pleased. It's a waste of energy and time.

This is why I don't really need to prove anything about cycling. I stop at red lights for me, not to prove that cyclists are law abiding. The same goes for every other activity. 

I said this before, and I'll say it again, I have no use for a united do nothing cycling "community" nor anything else regarding cycling.

I have no reason to lie about how dangerous cycling is nor the amount of abuse that cyclists can get.

This lack of concern is a great source of freedom that I'm only beginning to explore.

Unlike most Americans, for me, the notion of freedom for no purpose other than freedom itself isn't my biggest concern. I can see some real pain and harm to others through too much of certain types of freedom.

Also, if what passes for freedom makes one less wise and clouds the mind, is it really freedom at all? Perhaps one is more free if one has a clear mind.

For me, I'd rather have wisdom, happiness, love, and discipline. With these values, I have no concern that I'll act in an ethical way (most of the time) so I don't really have to worry.

As long as I do the right thing why else should I worry?]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Over on Public Space LA, there's a brilliant post:

http://losangelespublicspace.blogspot.com/2012/06/streets-as-obstacle-courses.html

Every now and then there's this YES moment when I feel like I have made a new mental breakthrough.

This post does it for me.

"Urban Adonia used the frame of the "obstacle course" to describe the collective and individual mentality possessed by some automobilers and perhaps some bicyclists on the road."

This is so brilliant because it explains some of the same notions that VC cyclists have which is that they don't want to be "caged" by bicycle lanes.

Yes, exactly, they expect to be able to go anywhere on the road as they see fit. So do motorists who wish to buzz us!

This gives me a great deal of empathy for nobody because I do see the roads as a shared space for the greater good of the community, and I don't mind being limited actually, if it feels fair and makes the world a safer, more comfortable, and efficient place.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Fair Cost Benefit Analysis</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/06/13/fair-cost-benefit-analysis/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[In every cost benefit analysis, I have seen regarding government cycling spending, there are grievous errors.

That is, each analysis begs the question:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question

(Yes, I know this phrase is used and abused, but I mean it in its original form.)

That is, the purported goal is to prioritize spending based on how much money we have.

In it, we have to decide what we can afford to build.

However, if we have all ready decided _what_ we will build BEFORE we do the analysis, then the whole point of the analysis is lost.

If I want to see if I can live in a luxury home, but then I decide that it's a given that I'm going to be on the beach in Malibu and have fourteen bedrooms, then you'd laugh at me.

However, if I were to do a transportation study, and decide that we must spend most of our money on the least efficient and most expensive mode, then you'd give me a job.

Why?

BECAUSE EVEN BIKE ADVOCATES ASSUME MOTORING FOR EVERYONE AS A GIVE; BECAUSE OF THIS BICYCLES WILL ALWAYS LOSE.

Again:

ASSUMING MONEY FOR PARKING AND ROADS FOR THE ENTIRE POPULATION TO DRIVE EVERYWHERE MEANS CYCLING WILL SUCK.

Let's look at it a different way.

If there were only walking paths to people's jobs then they would work closer to home and not drive.

On the other end of the spectrum, if I had a helicopter and there were helipads on my house and my job reserved just for me, jobs in LA would look a whole lot more "practical".

Then I'd look at places like where I work now and decide that I can't work there because "there's no (helicopter) parking)."

And so on.

At the same time, cycling is seen as something that only yellow clad, alien headed freaks will do and we get that result. Amazing!

So when we say, "we can't afford to cycle", the evidence in favor of this conclusion will come only as some tightly wound tautology.

Finally, there's a similar fallacy called a "complex question" that is also used to make cycling seem impossibly expensive:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_question

These questions assume that cycling is NOT affordable such as "can we afford cycling infrastructure."

Of course, we can afford it, but the question itself is unfair because it assumes something that's totally untrue.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Beyond Arrogance; Beyond Government Intervention</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/06/14/beyond-arrogance-beyond-government-intervention/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[If you are a long time reader, you can skip this as it's just a repeat of old stuff repackaged to make a point.

This is a blog response to the stupid questions that come up whenever bicycles are mentioned...

1. Why are cyclists so arrogant?

Um, I'm not really sure what this means. Please show me how I can ride a bicycle in a manner to instantly convey that I am a very humble person. As a good friend said, and I have often quoted, a bicycle is in its very nature, a very humble form of transportation. How can I display this to the world?

2. Why do cyclists want my gas money?

Again, without government intervention at all, please let me know how I can get around as safely, efficiently, and comfortably as in a car without any government help at all.

As I have said before, the billions of dollars in spent in "transportation" (sic) are what make cycling suck in San Diego.

Had the government spent nothing, I could easily get around on mountain bike trails. 

There would almost be no fatalities. 

Travel times would be a bit higher, probably, but that would be expected, and I'd gladly pay that price for the quiet.

So it's not really gas money I want, but rather for the government to fix the transportation nightmare that it has created by building freeways everywhere which I can only cross in designated areas.

I have read that 10 miles of freeway expansion (one lane!) is going to cost 1 billion dollars. That means that we are talking 100 million dollars per mile.

So basically for the price of a few lanes, the freeway budget could easily mitigate itself, but instead, we choose to build a system with automatic fatalities and then pretend like they are a tragedy or the fault of the cyclist.

No!

Cycling is nearly 100% safe without cars.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>SEC: Comfort</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Note this is the first in a three part series.

When people ask me what I want in cycling, SEC is the shortest answer I can give: security, efficiency, and comfort.

Let's start with comfort.

To me, comfort is obvious, but in the magic of the biking world--hi, John!--this is hopelessly confused.

When a car company puts out a luxury car or an airline is rated highest in comfort, there's not a lot of debate.

This is a good thing and it's worth it.

Similarly, we don't whine about climate control or cooked food, either.

Comfort is good.

Duh!

But few advocates are brave enough to ask for comfort.

What is this mysterious comfort?

First of all, it's quiet. That's one of the gifts a cyclist gives to her community, silence. 

Is she praised for this? Sometimes, but often she is considered to be annoying, arrogant, and a self-righteous "little Christ of the road".

Comfort is freedom from fear which means that cars are far away. Where there are cars moving quickly nearby there's always a chance we can get hit. That's NOT comfort.

Comfort is having the right and space to ride side by side and hold a conversation.

Comfort is not having hills steeper than what a car has to drive up unless one wants to.

Comfort is getting on a bicycle with normal clothes without a thought of tools, helmets, yellow vests, or the other trash that other advocates think we should have at all times.

Comfort not ever having to answer questions about one's "lifestyle" because cycling is normal.

Basically, comfort is obvious, desirable, and this one little word encapsulates nearly everything that I want from cycling.

Nearly every world religion and moral system holds comfort to a high standard. Christ died so other people don't have to suffer so much in hell. That is heaven is comfort. 

Buddha had a hard life by our standards, but he did practice the middle way which meant that he eschewed torture for torture's sake. His practice was meant to create enduring mental comfort for the rest of one's life.

Moses took his people AWAY from Egypt and slavery not toward it.

There are only a few people who feel that comfort is totally unimportant: masochists (who are kind of cool), Spartans (who are striking for better working conditions and they no longer kill their young), and VCers who totally ignore the comfort issue when I bring it up. Usually when I speak to a VCer about "comfort" they bitch that I'm "fearful" as if it's some how stupid to fear getting run over.

If you think that comfort is a dirty word, then I have a bed of nails for you to sleep on. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>64 Ounces of Freedom</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/06/17/64-ounces-of-freedom/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I love the recent move in New York City to attempt to ban extra large sodas.

I know that many people are very, very afraid for their freedom, but I think that it's silly to worry about a big gulp.

Worse, I feel that the urge to cry out for freedom is a wrong, and in this day and age ignorant.

Science has research how our minds work, and it has discovered that things are not always as they appear.

Thus, we have the older, crusty ideology which bemoans a loss of freedom, is really a false belief in free will.

On the contrary, if you read such books as _You Are Not So Smart_, you'll realize that we are not the rational robots that we believe we are. Not only that but to make a decision at your arm chair is much different than making a decision in a store.

Yes, that's right, you can make all the perfect decisions at home, but this all goes out the window when you are actually faced with an extra large soda.

Here's an article showing how this is also true in other fields such as economics:

http://articles.latimes.com/2005/may/11/nation/na-nobel11

Unethical companies, who care very little about real American freedom, have figured this out and exploited this loop hole in human psychology to trick us into doing things that we don't want to do.

If being manipulated against our will is "freedom" then yes this law impinges on our freedom. 

However, I believe that this law makes us more free because it helps us to make better health and financial decisions.

But what about the "Nanny State".

That phrase is stupid and not useful.

But I'll address this.

Basically, everyone in the entire political spectrum believes that the government must protect us from terrorists.

A trillion dollars later a handful of arrests, we are really, really safe from a tiny number of bad men who manage to knock off some Americans each year.

However, the real killers such as diabetes  are killing us in vast numbers. 

Thus, the debate is not about the government protecting us, but rather WHO the government protects.

At this point in time, we are spending more effort and money protecting non-living things that living things.

Soft drink companies aren't alive and thus do not deserve a government protected right to exploit us in order to get us to do things against our will such as suck on shit food all day. This is especially true with artificial things such as soda which nature gives us less protection from than regular food. This is because we are not evolved to control our calorie input from liquid food only from solid food. Again, this is some basic, well known research that the Nanny State Whiners are totally ignorant of. 

VC mentality is the same way.

On paper, we can learn all the right moves to ride our bicycles. Similarly, motorists can learn how to do a better job at not killing us.

But when the time comes, we will make the wrong moves. Over and over again.

It's no use judging us because you are no smarter than the rest of us. We're all fallible.

Fortunately, we have an arm chair and science to help us deal with our fallibilities. We can get together to create something bigger than ourselves as we can't do it all on our own.

This something is called the US government. It protects us from terrorists and from soft drink companies.

More information on this concept can be found in _The Art of Choosing_: http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Choosing-Sheena-Iyengar/dp/0446504106].

And I find it strange that people like Fox News are not investigated, like left wing groups are, for their ties to anti-American propadanda such as the phrase "Nanny State" which is full of vile hatred towards two things we know and love, the government and our maternal protectors. 

http://www.foxnews.com/health/2012/06/12/report-wants-to-know-how-much-soda-is-bought-with-food-stamps/

But I guess it's more fun to throw mom under the bus instead of realizing, at our arm chair, that if we really, really want to excercise our right to give ourselves diabetes and the years of hassle and suffering that entails, we can buy two smaller sodas and suck them both down.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>SEC: Safety</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Long time readers (LTRs) should be bored so you can skip this one if you are a LTR.

I have posted before that I don't care about safety.

This isn't totally true. 

I hate _feeling_ unsafe.

As far as "being" unsafe, it's kind of hard to know when this is really objectively true especially when we have debates as to whether it would be safer to ride on a totally protected bike path which has no motoring traffic anywhere near it or whether it's safer to mix it up as I pedal along at eight miles per hour as trucks road by me at fifty plus.

No, if the latter is safety, then I don't give a shit about safety at all.

I do want to feel that I am protected by the government which has "vowed to protect us":

"Bush told a southwestern Michigan audience of nearly 2,500 -- the largest he has addressed in the United States since leaving the White House in January -- that, after the September 11 attacks, "I vowed to take whatever steps that were necessary to protect you.""

http://edition.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/05/29/george.bush.speech/

Senator Obama applauded the decision and said the following:

"Today's Supreme Court decision ensures that we can protect our nation and bring terrorists to justice, while also protecting our core values."

http://www.thepoliticalguide.com/Profiles/President/US/Barack_Obama/Views/Homeland_Security/

For me, the biggest threat to my personal safety are automobiles, which is why Obama has outlawed them as part of his socialist agenda.

Oops, he wants to build more!

"The study helps explain the impasse in Washington as President Barack Obama calls for transportation investments: Many lawmakers agree on the need for more highway spending but are averse to taking politically risky steps to raise funding."

http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2011/02/28/poll-yes-on-highway-spending-no-on-higher-gas-tax-to-fund-it/

At any rate. If these dangerous roads are being built, I suggest we build some infrastructure to make things safer.

Thus, when say safety, I mean infrastructure, NOT segregation.
Or as I like to say: physical safety improvements to the road.

Anything that gets us off the road is good even bike paths which are actually safer than the travel lane.

So sharrows are kind of pointless. Plus they look stupid anyway.

I don't really care about education or "enforcement". What do you think it will take for the cops to actually care about cyclist's deaths? I suggest taking their cars away and forcing them to ride, for an hour and a half each day in plain clothes. Nothing less will work.

So I think that the best way is to build roads so safely that people can text while they drive all day and be totally stupid otherwise.

Oh, by objective safety, I mean that we can do some studies to get some real data on how safe things really are. I am 100% confident that most infrastructure will be found to be safer than any other method of making things safer and more cost effective. This is objective safety.

No class (to my knowledge) nor any increase in police enforcement budget has been show to increase road safety at all. If it has, I'm open to seeing a peer reviewed study that shows this.

"A 1985 US study showed that about 34% of serious crashes had contributing factors related to the roadway or its environment. Most of these crashes also involved a human factor.[6] The road or environmental factor was either noted as making a significant contribution to the circumstances of the crash, or did not allow room to recover. In these circumstances it is frequently the driver who is blamed rather than the road; those reporting the accident have a tendency to overlook the human factors involved, such as the subtleties of design and maintenance that a driver could fail to observe or inadequately compensate for."

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision

This is why I despise the useless term "counter-measure". This assumes that we are some how gods who have total control over our environment.

This is nonsense. I all ready ride as safely as possible, but I still find that I am afraid and annoyed far more than I'd like to be.

Finally, by subjective safety, I refer to whether or nor someone will let their toddler learn to ride on that road. If a toddler can't ride on it then the road is not safe.

End of story.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Empty PSAs Do Nothing to Promote Safety</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[OK, another repeat, but Unbound is fired up.

Recently, princess sent me a story which I had read in print a long time ago:

http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2010/apr/21/cover/

I had read the story, but never really thought about the implications.

Now, we are here again.

First all caps for the skimmers (you know who you are) :)

PROMOTING SOMETHING IS NOT THE SAME AS GETTING PEOPLE TO DO IT.

This holds for many things.

Texting and driving is bad, but cell phone bans in cars do not reduce the number of serious injuries and deaths from car accidents.

What!?!

PROMOTING SOMETHING IS NOT THE SAME AS GETTING PEOPLE TO DO IT.

Yes, advertising can work, but putting out an advert is a lame proxy for real change.

Here, I am treating PSAs and more "enforcement" of new laws together.

For helmets, it's the same thing.

Yes, the guy got injuried badly. Would a helmet have helped? Probably, but we can't be sure because we can't run reality backwards. There are cases where helmets make things worse.

However, there's still the problem of getting him to wear a helmet. Did someone tell him to wear a helmet every in his life? Probably.

PROMOTING SOMETHING IS NOT THE SAME AS GETTING PEOPLE TO DO IT.

Did he wear one? No.

Thus, I'm just saying that it's probably a waste of effort to promote helmets.

I'm not saying NOT to wear a helmet. I try not to boss other people around (unless they are experts without an 'E'). Also, the Unbound lawyer told me NOT to tell people to not wear helmets. Just kidding, I make up my own laws as I go along.

Promoting helmets is bad because it makes cycling seem dangerous and it robs people of the benefits. The helmet message has been put out there loud and clear so everyone knows that wearing a helmet is similar to eating kale: it flushes out toxins.

So promoting helmets does not work.

It hurts cycling, which is why so many anti-cyclists are eager to pass helmet laws.

It makes cycling seem more dangeous than it is.

Cycling ALONE, is many, many, many times safer than motoring. Only when we are forced to mix with cars does it get deadly. Wearing a helmet does NOTHING to solve this problem, and it gives a false sense of security.

Helmets encourage closer passing by cars and they definitely encourage dickish and sometimes deadly behavior by cyclists.

Here's an example of the latter:

http://www.sfbg.com/politics/2012/04/05/was-cyclist-who-killed-pedestrian-reckless

“The quote/unquote 'scene of the crime' was that intersection right by the landmark Castro Theatre – it leads from a really busy MUNI station to that little plaza where The Naked Guy always hangs out. It was commuter hour and it was crowded as all getup. I couldn't see a line through the crowd and I couldn't stop, so I laid it down and just plowed through the crowded crosswalk in the least-populated place I could find."

To put this in plain English, he was riding much too fast down a a hill (something I never do because I don't wear a helmet).

Then he deliberately plowed into pedestrians. Again, I'd never do this because I am a human with feelings for others. But also because I'd probably fall off my bike and hit my head which is exposed.

Guess what happened?

"I don't remember the next five minutes but when I came to, I was in a neck brace being loaded into an ambulance. I remember seeing a RIVER of blood on the asphalt, but it wasn't mine. Apparently I hit a 71-year old male pedestrian and he ended up in the ICU with pretty serious head injuries. I really hope he ends up OK."

Yes, this asshole hit someone and he could have broken his neck. Why no neck protection, helmet people?

“In closing, I want to dedicate this story to my late helmet. She died in heroic fashion today as my head slammed into the tarmac. Like the Secret Service would do for a president, she took some serious pavement today, cracking through-and-through in five places and getting completely mauled by the ragged asphalt. May she die knowing that because she committed the ultimate sacrifice, her rider can live on and ride on. Can I get an amen?

“Amen.

“The moral of this little story is: WYFH”

Several members of the newsgroup took issue with the lesson Bucchere claims to have learned : WYFH, or “Wear Your Fucking Helmet.”

See how proud he was of his helmet? He thought he'd be fine no matter what (even though I know that's not true).

Who can argue, after that, that the helmet did not play a role in his aggressive cycling?

How about changing our tune to "As cyclists, voluntarily, yield to and respect others. The street is NOT a race track. Pedestrians are friends and not obstacles. You should ride where you feel in control at all times. Whether or not you wear a helmet, you should ride, in the streets, where you take no excessive risk to yourself or others."

There's a time and place for risk taking. I ALWAYS wear a helmet when I skateboard. I find that a helmet makes me push myself to take more risks.

DO WE REALLY WANT TO LIE TO CYCLISTS, TELLING THEM THAT A HELMET CAN KEEP THEM SAFE SO THAT THEY GO OUT, TAKE RISKS, AND KILLS MORE PEOPLE?

So the moral is, I don't care if you wear a helmet or not, but don't tell other people what to do.

Let's stop saying WYFH and start saying, "be kind."]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Are All Motorists Responsible for Drag Racing?</title>

Note that this is a rhetorical question. I'd never blame the many for the actions of the few. In fact, many would find this question to be biased and insulted.

Those many would be right.

"Illegal street racing continues to advance in popularity, especially among young male adults. Nationally and internationally, illegal street racing is claiming hundreds of lives and injuring thousands annually."

These events did not have any police involvement.  They were done solely for the enjoyment of those involved.

As a result, did the motor vehicle industry get a black eye? Were the newspaper editorials threatening the lives of random soccer moms who "took their life into their own hands" by motoring?

No, no, no.

Did the motoring community, as a whole come out against drag racing? Were random motorists asked about NASCAR? Did the motoring community set up special voluntary classes, in addition to driver's ed, which are voluntary to teach lawful motoring?

No, no, no.

The motoring community was largely silent about this. I didn't get any personal apologies for this nor did any motorist dissociate herself from this rabble. Nor were they forced to defend their mode of transportation against critics.

No newspapers called for the government banning or cracking down on legal motorists in retaliation for drag racing.

This shows a clear bias against cycling.

Search and replace, above with critical mass and look at the media response to it.

One might argue that this is because cycling is "impractical" but it depends upon what you want to practice.

I don't have a time machine, but I argue had the government, over the last few decades, spent .6 trillion USD on cycling, we would not have to contend with knuckle heads in the media.

Note, that drag racing kills HUNDREDS. This is from a pro-racing site. How many people did CM kill?

So let's be polite. Let's not break any laws. But let's keep our responses in proportion to the damage that they do.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>SEC: Efficiency I</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/06/21/sec-efficiency-i/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Before I post this, I just have to write more about the recent SF: pedestrian/cyclist collision which resulted in a pedestrian death.

First of all, I do hope that they do pursue this, but the ultimate result of his guilt is up to the courts, so I won't presume either way. I did not, personally, like the initial tone of his post about the collision, of course.

Also, here's the voice of reason on this whole thing:

http://sfcitizen.com/blog/2012/04/17/if-chris-bucchere-is-guilty-is-it-possible-that-cyclists-have-been-responsible-for-more-sf-pedestrian-deaths-than-drivers-in-2012/

This is supposed to be the final article on this notion.

To recap, when asked what I want for cycling to be improved, I mention SEC: safety, efficiency, and comfort.

Efficiency means many, many things. 

First let's talk about what efficiency is not.

Many people use efficiency to mean faster. If you want to say faster, just say it.

Any time there's efficiency, there's a division problem.

When people use efficiency to say faster, they really mean more distance covered per unit of time.

In this sense, motoring is the most efficient way to get around.

Sometimes.

In dense cities such as Philadelphia, motoring is sometimes the slowest way to get around. 

Of course, they can widen the roads and build more parking. Or they could just gut the whole city and destroy all the things that made it special and relocate the Liberty Bell on top of a drive thru taco shack. 

But this would be inefficient in so many other ways such as space and cost.

Thus, to me, to say a mode of transportation is efficient, it's really a combination of categories that we should consider.

Cycling loses in most of these cases. However, LTRs know that since this site is cycling hagiography, the bike always wins.

Thus, I'd say that cycling hits the sweet spot for all the efficiency categories.

In fact, if you exclude cycling, it almost seems like the system has a conservation of efficiency.

That is, walking is the most efficient in terms of cost and space, but it's much slower than motoring.

A bicycle seems to defy these categories by being number two.

Cycling is almost as space efficient as walking, but not quite. It's almost as inexpensive as walking. And its' almost as fast as motoring.

When you factor in the fun, cool, and health benefits, I think that cycling wins hands down.

Of course, cars are the coolest mode. Who got laid in the back of a bicycle.

On the other hand, bicyclists bodies are the sexiest of the three at least by modern western ideals. So while you might want to lose it in the back of a truck, who wants to do it with a guy who sat behind the wheel, on his ass all days while sucking down Liberty Bell tacos?

But by efficiency for this post, I meant something quite different. 

(To be continued.)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>SEC: Efficiency II</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[OK, when I meant efficiency, as part of safety and comfort in transportation, I meant efficiency in government spending.

Again, efficiency means what we get for what we spend.

Thus, cycling is energy efficient.

However, I feel that when done right, it's also government spending efficient.

This is because cycling infrastructure costs much less than what would be done by motoring. It's only when the two costs are combined which assumes that we'll all ride bicycles AND drive everywhere at the same time does the spending look a bit high.

Still, spending on motoring is higher and thus, we should question whether we do it at all in some places. Of course, we'll need to build fire roads, but smaller fire trucks, are also more cost efficient so we should scale back for this.

I suggest mandating that a complete network for cycling and walking be put into place first then have the roads work around that. With these modes prioritized, we should see a cost savings of at least ten times.

That money can go back as a tax break.

Furthermore, I feel that if we have separate cycling infrastructure, cycling would take less time. Plus, if we had the freeway grade of only a few percent, there would be no hills and cycling would be even faster and easier. Again, this is far less than the freeway system and would literally cost pennies on the dollar.

It's not that I don't want the motoring stuff to be built, I just feel that motorists have not made a case for each and every road, but rather they are built automatically as a given while those who walk and cycle are forced to walk around them and to beg for money that should have been spent on them from the beginning if the politicians and government really cared about saving money at all.

Finally, places where bicycles are popular are packed with people while places where motoring is preferred, you can hardly find anyone around. Plus there's the wasted space for the parking lots and freeways where we could have been building businesses and homes which could be taxed instead of the permanent government liability we have in maintaining the roads.

Also, I'd argue that any safety improvements such as guard rails should work in the favor of all modes rather than just make motoring safer. Otherwise, people will just drive faster and get into the same number of collisions, but cycling and walking will be less safe.

Finally, separate infrastructure for each mode will ensure the least number of collisions and when there are collisions they will be less harmful especially for the non-motorized users.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Whole Lotta Crashin' Going On</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[LTRs can skip this one.

OK, here we go again. 

One thing that keeps coming up over and over and over again is "taking the lane" or Savvy Cycling or whatever name they are calling it tis week is safer than cycling infrastructure.

We get lots and lots of studies and graphs and so on.

However, what we don't get is a good study.

Here's an example of how to conduct a good study:

http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/test-learn-adapt-developing-public-policy-randomised-controlled-trials

Now this is a Five Minute Google BlogTM, not a well research one.

So we'll just skim through this.

The way to tell if VC is safer than a bicycle lane is to get half the population WHO ALL READY WANTS TO RIDE VC to ride on the bike lane and the other half to ride VC. Then we need to get half the population who NEVER WANTS TO RIDE VC to actually ride VC and the other half to ride in their bike lane.

The lanes have to be on comparable streets.

Note that this experiment is impossible.

All the studies on bike safety are based upon incomplete data.

SOME WHO SAYS, I RIDE 100 MILES A DAY FOR THE PAST 300 YEARS WITH NARY A CLOSE CALL IS TOTALLY STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT.

That's right, we just don't have a big enough N to say anything with such scanty data.

There are 196,165,666  motorists in the US (http://www.statemaster.com/graph/trn_lic_dri_tot_num-transportation-licensed-drivers-total-number)

If each person drove for 2 hours a day there would be about 400 million hours of exposure a day. Multiply this by 365 and you get a really huge number.

But there are about 5.5 million collisions in the US per year. Which makes the chance per motorist per year to be about 1/40.

That's all collisions combined. 

That's pretty huge. Not too risky due to safer cars.

However, there are still half a million serious brain injuries a year in motoring. (http://www.cdc.gov/Features/dsTBI_BrainInjury/)

So motoring, while seen as safe, if pretty rough as a whole.

There are 2.5 rear endings a year in motoring. IMAGINE 2.5 MILLION PEOPLE GETTING REAR ENDED ON THEIR BICYCLES ARE THEY LESS OR MORE LIKELY TO BE SERIOUSLY HURT?

This is the crux of the debate.

We have no good data, but we have circumstantial evidence that getting hit by a car is likely to hurt or kill you.

There is ZERO EVIDENCE THAT SAYS VC IS SAFE, MOST PRO-VC EVIDENCE IS ACTUALLY ANTI-INFRASTRUCTURE CHERRY PICKING.

Again, we have no studies to prove things one way or another so I suggest that we forget real safety until we have more evidence to worry about it.

Riding on the road is obviously not safe, but we can't perform a super duper rigorous study to prove it. There are a lot of things in life that are unsafe, and we can't prove all of them, but we don't do them anyway. How many double blind jumping off high buildings studies do we need to prove it's not recommended?

The point is that there is zero evidence that prove that well designed, connected, tested, and coherent infrastructure poses a public safety risk and those who say this are lying through their teeth.

Let's collect better data, but let's not lie and say things that we can't prove.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>What is a Troll</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I have noticed that in my VC debates on VC blogs as well as via email, eventually, they call me a troll.

This happens when I get them cornered and tied up in their own illogic. Instead of realizing that I'm actually more intelligent and less "fearful" (though I do like to be pampered so if this == fearful, bring on the fear).

Anyway, when I feel that when I am personally attacked, such as being called a troll, I have won the debate and should move on.

However, I wondered if I were a troll, really.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_%28Internet%29

In one definition you could make a case that I am (though you can make a case for anything).

I am passionate and outspoken about what I believe in, and I write in an emotional manner.

However, this gave me pause:

"Trolls aspire to violence, to the level of trouble they can cause in an environment. They want it to kick off. They want to promote antipathetic emotions of disgust and outrage, which morbidly gives them a sense of pleasure."

No.

I am not violent nor do I want outrage. I mainly want to be understood, which to me is the opposite of a troll because we are the types who can get suckered into a troll trap.

I think that the term troll should be reserved for those who ask questions or make remarks that they don't actually believe in. They do this to get an emotional reaction.

I don't do this.

I write about what I believe in only. This is normally called speaking one's mind.

But I guess VC sites don't want a diversity of opinions which is funny because they often go to other sites and whine about not being allowed to speak their minds.

I am on the other hand, have many, many unanswered questions.

Usually these questions are the ones that get me called a troll.

So on one hand, I am not going to be a mouth piece for an ideology that I disagree with.

On the other hand, I am open to honest questions about my views. I think that they make one stronger and smarter in the long run.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Before we have this post, I'd like to link to a amazing list of all the objections and their answers (Thanks Ted).

This is the most <a href="http://radwagon.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/common-misconceptions-on-road.html">comprehensive list of answersw to motorist's objections to cycling I ever saw.</a>

Here's the thought experiment. Answers are based upon the most common things that I have personally heard online.

Imagine there is a Traffic Genie in front of you. He is offering you three wishes for the future of transportation. What do you choose?

"All cyclists follow all traffic laws and to ride on the sidewalk."

** Ting **

Your wish is granted.

I predict that this is going to very little impact on traffic because most of it is based upon the mass of ALL THE CARS ON THE ROAD. But hey, it's not my wish.

Also, now we won't have to hear any more whining from motorists any more about how they hate cyclists because they are FOLLOWING ALL YOUR RULES. Thus, cyclists have the moral high ground.

Every single time a cyclists is hit by a car, we know with 100% certainty that the cyclist did NOT make a mistake.

On the other hand, most cyclists deaths recently have been by cyclists who have been riding legally, so this isn't going to be silver bullet to make things safer for cyclists. I think that things will not change for safety much. On the other hand, cycling on the sidewalk is far slower so commute times will go up. Many cyclists will quit so that traffic will actually increase, but only slightly so nobody will notice.

In fact, no motorist will notice cyclists at all so they will stop whining about them or thinking about them. In a year, the most rabid anti-cyclists will be back to their baseline happiness.

On the other hand, pedestrians are even more fed up. They wish that cyclists get into the streets (too bad, peddy, no wish for you!) :)

Overall, not much will change at all.

Good job wasting a wish.

Next luck next time.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>VC Doctors and a Danish Hospital</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/06/29/vc-doctors-and-a-danish-hospital/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[First of all, I'd like to point out, for the thick, that I'm going to use some metaphors in this post. Metaphors are where you compare things that are not the same as if they were. So I don't want any more complaints (yes, this happened to me) that "hospitals" have nothing to do with "cycle tracks". 

No shit. That's why it's a metaphor.

If they were related then it would be a comparison.

Anyway, when talking to VC people, I imagine talking about a hospital instead of cycle tracks to a VC person.

Me: Hey, they have this new stuff, antibiotics, that cures lots of infetions in the Netherlands! We should use it here.

VC: But this is San Diego, not Amsterdam. It won't work here.

Me: Why not?

VC: Because it's not San Diego.

Me: Let's just try and see. If it really fails, we'll stop using it.

VC: OK, but first we must make sure that it's safe.

Me: They said that it is, though occasionally someone has an allergic reaction. But people here are dying in droves of infections and they are all cured over there.

VC: OK, it's NOT safe! If a single person has a single problem then it's not safe.

Me: Um...

VC: Plus, what if the reason for the Danish success is that they are racial different?

Me: Dutch?

VC: What?

Me: You said Danish, aka Denmark. I am talking about the Dutch aka Netherlands.

VC: Don't nitpick me!

Me: The point is that this stuff is really great and we should try is on some patients.

VC: But it's expensive!

Me: We have people who are willing to pay right now to try it.

VC: But it's not part of US standard practice.

Me: That standard was made before we discovered antibiotics. Plus the standard says nothing that contra-indicates antibiotics so let's try it.

VC: But if we use it, it might become popular then we could never get rid of it.

Me: Um, send it back to the Netherlands? They said that they would take it back. Plus purchasing said that they could get a full refund in 24 hours.

VC: I have heard that a lot of people want to try antibiotics. Seems like a popularity contest to me.

Me: Right. It's popular and it works. Here's a paper that proves it.

VC: There's a comma splice here?

Me: WHAT?!?

VC: I found a single mistake here. Because there's a single mistake in this study, I will reject the entire thing.

Me: There's lots more data.

VC: Like this one, which shows that 99% of people will DIE if they get near an antibiotic. We must keep this disease out of here.

Me: But it was written by Dr. Trees, who invented blood letting. If we use antibiotics, we won't have blood letting anymore. So it's a conflict of interest.

VC: Exactly!

Me: Huh?!

VC: If we have antibiotics, we won't have blood letting. Blood letting kills the weak which is great. Only the strong survive. If we have antibiotics, then "incompetent patients" will survive. That's not what you want is it?

Me: Yes, that's exactly what I want.

VC: Plus, if we start curing people, we'll have more people coming to the hospital. We don't want that, do we?

Me: If they are sick, yes, they should come to the hospital.

VC: Yes, they will come here where they will die!

Me: Um, only if you didn't blood let them! That's what's killing people. Antibiotics will save them so we can send them home.

VC: Prove it.

Me: Here's a few studies.

VC: Missing a period, scale on graph is not 100%, and there's no abstract. I must reject each and every paper on the grounds that they don't meet my standards.

Me: What are your standards for selecting data?

VC: I can't tell you.

Me: Why?

VC: Because I'm an expert.

Me: Experts are trained by other experts who write their knowledge in a book in a systematic way.

VC: Blood letting experts don't. I have  a BLD: blood letting degree. I'm an expert.

Me: That's not even a reliable certification. Mr. Trees made up his own paper degree and now he acts like he's a real doctor.

VC: Don't insult the experts. Are you some kind of troll?

Me: No! God, I forgot why I am even here. Do you remember.

VC: No.

(If this argument went in circles for decades this might actually resemble how it feels to debate VCers on infrastructure.)]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Like everywhere else, where you'd think that we'd find the biggest kinship, you often find the most discord.

First of all, I am going to, on behalf of ALL WORLD CYCLISTS, to apologize for us behaving like dicks. There, I said it. You have a formal apology. Can we please move on now?

Second, I will call ALL WORLD CYCLISTS to please, please, for the love of God and everything that's holy and profane to stop behaving like a dick. Really stop.

Stop road racing. Get a track. If you're too poor for that, work a second shift. Stop treating mixed use trails like a velodrome.

And for crying out loud DON'T YELL AT CHILDREN!! WTF! This so enraged me:

http://www.ocregister.com/articles/mountain-360600-trail-children.html 

(as usual thanks Ted for writing my blog for me)

OK, happy? 

We got that out of the way now.

Here's the problem: "Why is it that when somebody complains to me about outdoor manners, it's usually about road cyclists or mountain bikers?

I'm not saying that all mountain bikers are bullies. The overwhelming majority would rather crash into cactus than harm anyone.

But if there's a problem, it always seems to involve a mountain biker or roadie scaring someone on horseback or foot."

I imagine a really high pitched, whiny Chris Rock voice, "why are ONLY cyclists dicks? Why is just cyclists?"

OK, again, all apologies for the past and vows of patience, and kindness for the future, but you asked. 

I don't lecture people, but occasionally, I'll answer a question.

Why?

PEOPLE ON BICYCLES SEEM LIKE DICKS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO WHERE TO RIDE! (Note I did NOT say "cyclists"? That's because they don't exist. Cyclists are more likely to have cars than no cyclists so I could have accurately said, motorists who happen to be on a bike at the time.)

That's right, I said it. Cyclists are forced to share space with pedestrians. Since we are stuck together and we move at differing speeds, we'll get conflicts.

WHEN THERE'S A CONFLICT THE BIGGER AND FASTER OBJECT SEEMS LIKE THE DICK.

Thus, what I said above. On a bike, you gotta yield for pedestrians.

"But, but, you say, there was a lot of bad bikers."

Well, sorry, but I'm not one of them. I dismount and WALK BY BICYCLE WHEN PASSING A PEDESTRIAN ON THE SIDEWALK. WHEN PEDESTRIANS TAKE UP THE BIKE LANE, I CAREFULLY ENTER THE MOTORING TRAVEL LANE TO GIVE THE PERSON FOUR FEET OR MORE.

OK, so there are nice cyclists out there.

But if you want to get the dicks away from you, you need to advocate for cycling areas, only. Then when we get them, STAY OFF THEM.

That's right, pedestrians (who usually motor) argue against cycling stuff. Then when cyclists get a tiny trail built, the motorist/pedestrians want to park and walk a few feet all the while bitching about how the "bike are ruining nature." We are not ruining nature. Mountain bikers, as a group, are preservationists. They happen to attract a few dicks. Sorry. We can't do anything about it except what I'm doing here.

If you really care about nature, STOP BRINGING YOUR SMELLY SUV TO NATURE. Or just ignore me and bring it anyway. I really don't care.

Would I ride an SUV to nature? Yes! But I won't be a hypocrite by whining about cyclists, horses, pedestrians, and no, I will NOT complain about children.

On the other hand, I do question the sanity of their parents.

Would you let your kids play in a busy street? No. Should the cars stop for your kid? Yes. Why don't you put them in street then?

Because it's really stupid. 

In some ways, multi-use paths, get treated, by default, because the motoring aliens gave us nothing else, like streets. You don't like it, I don't like it. Spend more on cycling or leave us alone. I'm stuck on a path with pedestrians and dogs. These people generally have no sense of their own safety nor my own. I tend to slow down to a track stand when I'm around them. 

But I really do wish that they would treat me with a tiny bit more of respect rather than a dangerous nuisance.

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Um, no, both can kill you.

If you are completely fine with the massive amount of carnage that trucks do each year, then we have no common ground at all.

It's like we are two different beings entirely.

I make mistakes all the time. You are apparantly perfect.

Thus, it's _me_ that I need to look out for. I do this by asking for things to be made safely around me.

I know you don't believe me, but I do believe I"m the safest and most courteous driver on the road.

This does NOT make me feel safe nor does it give me hope. 

I have been buzzed by very large trucks all the fucking time. So did Keri and she admitted this on her blog. There is NOTHING you can do about it except for die.

Now's the time to act. Let's make local trips in cities with smaller trucks and get the big and dangerous trucks OUT of our neighborhoods.

They'd be quieter and calmer and I believe safer, but you seem to think that truckers are infallible instead of normal humans like me. Of yeah, you're infallible. Well good for you. Too made that matters very, very little when riding on the roads for your own safety.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Interesting site, but it supports my contention. Specifically, in the conclusions, the report states:

"approximately 10 times as many fatalities result in sideswipe opposite direction crashes where the passenger vehicle encroached into the truck’s lane, compared to sideswipe opposite direction crashes where the truck encroached into the passenger vehicle’s lane. This might suggest that the drivers of the passenger vehicles are somewhat more reckless or over confident than the large truck drivers."

In other words, it is the Prius driver that we cyclists need to watch for.]]></wp:comment_content>

PERHAPS it is because vehicles (objects with wheels) simply do not belong on pavements containing the word "walk," - even if they claim to yield to people walking and stop at every driveway and corner. Even if they are afraid of the other choice in our own real world. In short, people on wheels on sidewalks ARE "a dangerous nuisance." To themselves and to a lot of others. As for me, "I'll take Texas."]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[You say that cyclists don't belong in the street, but when I ride in the street motorists--right before buzzing me to teach me a lesson--tell me to get on the sidewalk because "cyclists are a dangerous nuisance in the street".

So why are motorists wrong and you are right?

Most recent San Diego bicycle deaths were by people who rode lawfully, in the street. I don't know a single death that occured on a sidewalk here ever. Cops don't ticket sidewalk riding, and no pedestrians bitches at me when I ride on the sidewalk which is probably b/c I dismount and walkt past them instead of yelling at them. You failed to show one advantage to riding in the street except for speed and I am highly against speed because speed kills.

We should probably all just stop riding bikes altogether because pedestrians hate us, motorists hate us, and the government facitiltates our deaths then protects our killers.

Fuck it, I'm getting a semi! Look at how powerful the truck lobby is. Now they have some major balls unlike most cyclists advocates who are constanly trying to suck up to people who will never like them.

Truckers don't give a fuck--and they get their way.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[LTR no reason to read further. It's old wine in an old wine bottle here. 

Still, it's a red letter day that Forester has gone to his next fall back position!

LTRs know that I had penned a list of fall back positions and just as I predicted, it happened. It's magic like being able to predict a sunrise or something. :)

Previously, I had predicted what would happen to the future of the VC advocates where I said that they would back pedal away from safety.

They did.

My next prediction is that people are going to start tossing Forester, himself, under the bus.

Here's a recent quote from the man:

"There is a problem with making safety the paramount priority. Just prohibit cycling, and there should no longer be cyclist casualties. Any transportation program has to have a reasonable balance between safety and transportational effectiveness, what is commonly called convenience. In that respect, consider two possible designs. One design almost entirely excludes the possibility of car-bike collision but requires slow and out-of-direction operation with considerable probability of bike-bike collision. The other design keeps low the probability of car-bike collision for those cyclists who obey the rules of the road for drivers of vehicles and provides direct service as fast as the cyclist chooses to ride. One design might well be safer for a cyclist who does not obey the rules of the road, while the other is both safer and more useful for a cyclist who obeys the rules of the road. There is no reasonable way to say that one is necessarily safer than the other."

--John Forester

Note, how he picked up my value of efficiency which I had been pushing for a while.

However, if you look back at Forester's history he has said that bikeways were unsafe. When pressed, he started to say that it was not known if bikeways were safe which is a first step in back pedaling. Now, he seems to imply that cycling _can_ be made safer, if we want and he's moved on to speed of cycling.

Note that this has never been an argument for motorists to ride "as fast as they choose to drive." This is because it would be too dangerous. Speed limits try to reflect local norms, true, but racing on the streets is still highly illegal.

Here we see an earlier Forester:

https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:k8CwVl6dJAYJ:www.vtpi.org/puchertq2.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjcvK86I3Cmh4BU8NHyUllZ9Pt-Yt5DVsh8VDjo9ZfIbV0jx0r8fGGD8uzZP_sw7XzM4QZ6JnY3u-VxCpWMWFe5veDtJUHlnjMskLVbF2UMvMmZRb7BEyPT_nKG9q_HYv2iHw9Z&amp;sig=AHIEtbQW5uuz1oAK_2_dBWB9Wi1C-H_Jyw&amp;pli=1

Of course, the main problem is that Mr. Forester never thinks that perhaps we could have bicycle freeways where we could ride really fast with few to none intersections. This would make cycling faster _and_ safer.

And he continues to imply that VC cycling is reasonably safe without giving any numbers.

I have given numbers for vehicular collisions many times. At 2.5 million rear endings of automobiles, we can say that this happens quite often to "drivers of vehicles in the travel lane."

We know that bicycles getting hit by a car is often very ugly and quite often very deadly.

It only stands to reason if we act like cars, we'll have the same number of collisions and more fatalities. This should be stupidly obvious that the fact that I have to write this pisses me off.

It should also be clear that DESPITE DECADES OF TRANSPORTATION SAFETY SPENDING, NEARLY ALL OF WHICH HAS GONE SOLELY TO MAKING MOTORING SAFER, MOTORING STILL KILLS THE MOST PEOPLE COMPARED WITH OTHER MODES.

Also, note that many, many roads are fifty miles per hour or more here which makes them off limits to "taking the lane" unless one has a death wish.

At any rate, I'm glad that Forester has conceeded that infrastructure just might be safer.

If only he had spent his time and money studying more successful cycling systems instead of creating one which is not just inferior but so regressive as to be anti-cycling, San Diego would look a lot different.

At this point, we still have some questions to Forester:

1. What is the cut off for "safe"? 1 dead cyclist? 2? 3?

2. Due to his notion of "convenience" how many cyclists per year is he willing to sacrifice in order to make our streets "convenient"? 1 dead cyclist? Or perhaps seven like we have had, on average, for many years. 

In fact, though we can't predict how many will die, we can predict based on current infrastructure in differing cities how many people will die per year. These numbers are pretty stable. 

So if we say we "can't afford cycling infrastructure", we are also saying, "we can fully afford, we accept, and even condone seven funerals for cyclists and about seventy (that's 70) funerals for motorists per year".

Who talks like that?

I'm more in line with Sustainable Safety where we say, "one death is too many."]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Am I the only person who is totally sick of the lack of mention of bicycles when talking about green transportation?

I'm so, so sick of it.

Here's an example:

http://www.wired.com/autopia/2012/07/green-illusion/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+wired%2Findex+%28Wired%3A+Index+3+%28Top+Stories+2%29%29

Why are we even wasting money on green vehicles when they still force someone to sit inside and become a fatass, they take up as much space as a car, and they do more to shift pollution rather than eliminate it?

I was so excited to read about the "Green Illusion" of electric cars, but then there's nary a mention of bicycles as an alternative.

I know that many fear to combine cycling with environmentalism, but overall, everyone cares about the environment.

Sure there are idiots out there who have been programmed, like dogs, to salivate whenever they hear the phrase "global warming", but overall, we all do not like to breathe smog nor eat poison otherwise, we'd be dead.

While I realize that the tea bagger movement is making political hay out of going against anything that's even vaguely intelligent, the benefits of cycling, to me are so profound and obvious, that I can not understand how someone mentioning green travel will ignore them.

Give us a bone, at least a tiny sentence.

Lame.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Steve, we're all still learning.

I have no problem with smaller govt and self reliance but the tea bagger movement is high inconsistent. Surely you know this.

I'm sorry for calling you stupid, if I did, I write so much nonsense that I forget what I write. Yes, my writing is highly emotional, but I'm here to fill the gap in cycling blogging.

I feel that most people who are for infrastructure are way, way, too nice and thus they get tricked and run rough shod over by the tiny minority of cyclists who, like me, ride long enough to forget how scary, noisy, and dangerous it all _feels_ to a newbie.

My goal is to help those whom the VCers call stupid and fearful by making cycling slower, quieter, and more comfortable.

The fact is that the VC crew and the infrastructure crew are so far apart, they actually are enemies. Again, tricks from the VC camp pushes their agenda forward. Meanwhile, the infrastructure NEVER gets built.

I want cycle tracks everywhere. No less. If there's any kind of motoring allowed somewhere, I want a complete cycle track by blowing out an entire travel lane to build it. This will not cost a single dime more than the normal design. Heck let's blow out two lanes to build counter flow cycle tracks.

This position is not negotiable. I am interested in little else regarding cycling advocacy.

But yes, I do consider bike parking to be infrastructure, and I'm impressed that you got it built.

Usually, the VC crew says that they should do everything cycling, only, DIY, while ignoring how pampered and catered to motorists are.

I didn't realize that the anti-infrastructure bent did not apply to cycling parking.

In the future, I'll try to be more careful not to presume your opinions.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Bicycles "Belong" in the Street: My Response</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Many think that "cyclists belong in the street", but this is just another belief. It certainly does not feel safer to ride there nor is it pleasant. It's also not always legal.

Also, when I ride in the street motorists--right before buzzing me to teach me a lesson--tell me to get on the sidewalk because "cyclists are a dangerous nuisance in the street".

So why are motorists wrong and you are right?

Most recent San Diego bicycle deaths were by people who rode lawfully, in the street. I don't know a single death that occured on a sidewalk here ever. Cops don't ticket sidewalk riding, and no pedestrians bitches at me when I ride on the sidewalk which is probably b/c I dismount and walkt past them instead of yelling at them. You failed to show one advantage to riding in the street except for speed and I am highly against speed because speed kills.

We should probably all just stop riding bikes altogether because pedestrians hate us, motorists hate us, and the government facitiltates our deaths then protects our killers.

Fuck it, I'm getting a semi! Look at how powerful the truck lobby is. Now they have some major balls unlike most cyclists advocates who are constanly trying to suck up to people who will never like them.

Truckers don't give a fuck--and they get their way.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Again, LTRs can safely skip this post.

In fact, I'm going to stop saying this because I'm pretty much done with this blog. So no need to read this anymore. It will be a constant repeat like a bad broken record. 

Thanks for your time and see you around.

For the newer readers and those with some sick perversion to see my same nonsense repeated ad nauseum, welcome.

Here's a summary of what I learned by googling for a few years, five minutes at a time, as well as by cycling in many different locations:

CYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE, WHEN DONE WELL, MAKES CYCLING REALLY FUN, SAFE, EFFICIENT, AND COMFORTABLE. EVERYTHING ELSE, THE OTHER 2 OR 4 E'S SUCK THE ENERGY OUT OF INFRASTRUCTURE ADVOCACY AND THUS ARE A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME. THOSE WHO PUSH ANYTHING ELSE BESIDES INFRASTRUCTURE ARE LITERALLY KILLING US. 

Again, the only way to change my mind is to reprogram my brain. It's like the fact that I like punk rock music. You can point out how toneless and simplistic the music is. You can tell me how nihilistic and dumb the lyrics are. You can give me a course on Bach. But I'll still like punk rock.

Similarly, I love to ride in places like Copenhagen. While my commute is doable, it still sucks in comparison from a subjective point of view. No amount of graphs and diagrams and classes and brainwashing is going to change my mind.

I had smell and loud places. End of story.

I feel that we should work to make things quieter, safer, and cleaner. The VC crowd will never change their fight to allow traffic engineers to make my commute suckier and suckier until I finally give up and buy a car like everyone else and forget about cycling. This is what they have achieved.

The vast majority of outspoken VCers do not ride regularly and are full of excuses, but the main reason that they don't ride is because it sucks and they are in a state of denial over that.

Here's an example of a steaming pile of VC bullshit paid for by our government:

http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CEwQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.metroplanorlando.com%2Ffiles%2Fview%2Fbicyclist-crash-study.pdf&amp;ei=gQj2T7LkLOfi2QWE5ND0Bg&amp;usg=AFQjCNGwTEaAQo2aLM40c9Ljj0OZh8Rvjg&amp;sig2=Mu_P8ZgL8ggdQdQS6qkOnQ

Yes, I posted this before, I'm going into deeper detail into this pile of feces.

Thus, this marks the beginning of another series (note that I tend not to finish my series...) :)

The point of this is to respond to the misguided notion that cyclists are responsible for their own safety.

Nothing if further from the truth.

CYCLISTS SHOULD ALWAYS OBEY THE LAW, LOOK OUT FOR THEIR OWN AND THE SAFETY OF OTHERS AND GO ABOVE AND BEYOND THEIR CALL OF DUTY IN ORDER TO SHOW COMPASSION AND PATIENT FOR OTHERS. 

OK. We got that nonsense out of the way. If you get nothing else out of this, the above should be done by all cyclists.

Next point: From the stand point of most cyclists who died in San Diego, none of the above really mattered at all.

Let's look at the things that didn't save the cyclist: existence of eduction (doesn't matter if they got it or not, we had courses for over 30 years and it doesn't really seem to change anything), cyclists following the laws, and helmets.

We can do all of these things and cycling will still be annoying, dangerous, inefficient, and seldom done by anyone who does not look like an alien and is certifiably insane.

Cycling sucks and none of the above is going to change that much.

In fact, the more we stress the above, the more we'll avoid the elephant in the room which is the fact that in general cyclists fear motorists because they kill us all the time.

Sure sometimes a cyclist loses balance and dies. I'm not really interested in these cases because if I fall of my bicycle, that's on me. No question about it.

But this is usually not what kills the everyday cyclist. It's an incompetent motorist.

But here's the kicker, since we all make mistakes all the time, and crash data is really ambiguous, just like any other part of the uncontrolled conditions of the real world, YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND A CYCLIST VIOLATION TO BLAME THE CYCLIST FOR. AGAIN, YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND _SOMETHING_ A CYCLIST COULD HAVE DONE TO PREVENT AN ACCIDENT.

This doesn't mean that the cyclist was really at fault only you can blame a cyclist, if you really, really care to try.

This is the basis of Blame Bicycles First (BBF).

Why would you do that?

1. Shield motorists, at all costs, from liability. This is why the state does it ALL the time.

2. Shield a VC cyclist from their own personal fears. We went over this before. It's just like rape cases and clothing judgment: "she should not have worn that dress." By blaming the victim, we feel powerful where we believe that we would not have got into an accident in the same way.

The Orlando study is a case study in blaming the victim.

The funny thing is that the human mind naturally does this, too.

If there's a collision, there should be a human at fault, right?

WHAT IF BAD INFRASTRUCTURE WERE THE PROBLEM?

Over the next few posts, I plan on showing how an attack on cyclists via things like this study actually slows down the building of safer streets and contributes to future cyclists deaths.

This is why there are usually about the same number of deaths each year because no money is spent to make the streets safer for cyclists.

Again, for normal people, this is a no-brainer, but in the bizzaro VC cult, everything is our fault.

In fact, things get really fun when an LCI gets hit by a car. Then we rationalize that he's not really an LCI or he made a mistake or some other bullshit reason other than the fact that this was avoidable if we had just took the time to study what makes streets unsafe and we changed that.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Again, we get deeper into a bad study which is a case and point of a terrible approach to cycling safety.

http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CEwQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.metroplanorlando.com%2Ffiles%2Fview%2Fbicyclist-crash-study.pdf&amp;ei=gQj2T7LkLOfi2QWE5ND0Bg&amp;usg=AFQjCNGwTEaAQo2aLM40c9Ljj0OZh8Rvjg&amp;sig2=Mu_P8ZgL8ggdQdQS6qkOnQ

From the report:

“Bike safety” has come to be equated in large part with “helmets” and “bike paths.” Reliance on these strategies tends to reinforce the mistaken notion they are the most effective."

While I realize that helmets are not effective, there should be some evidence that bike paths are ineffective. Again, I had done detailed research which shows them to be much, much more effective than Eduction and Enforcement.

Building paths is also less expensive because most of the cost is a one time cost, while Education and Enforcement are almost infinite in their costs and their effects on safety are minimal.

"Such an approach leads people to believe
that “bike safety” is mostly about “things,” when it is in fact mostly about behavior."

Another unsubstantiated assertion. Again, bike safety is about things and behavior but behavior is shaped by the environment. Again: BEHAVIOR IS SHAPED BY THE ENVIRONMENT. This point is the biggest point of disagreement between Right and Left in the US and VC vs. normal citizens. The problem is that this has been demonstrated scientifically over and over again. A small change in the environment can cause huge behavioral changes. Knowing this, we have to take our environment into account.

A change of environment can make honest people dishonest as well as cause people to take bigger or smaller risks.

http://danariely.com/

Dan Ariely is the man when it comes to this research, but there's tons of this stuff out there. One who denies this is living in a superstitious past.

More nonsense:

"This discourages interest in real bicycling education and training."

NO!! This is 100% backward. If things were actually safe we would not need bike training. In fact, Forester said that all we need to know is how to drive a car in order to ride a bike. If I had car training, why do I need bike training? 

Plus, a riding a bike is really, really safe and simple. When you are dodging traffic things get really complicated. This is the fault of the road design which pits cars against cyclists NOT my problem. By making it my problem, the author of this paper is doing the entire bike community a HUGE disservice. Thanks.

"One goal of this report is to empower bicyclists, and to help them (as well as motorists, traffic engineers and
law enforcement officers) to understand the most effective strategies for reducing their risk."

The most effective strategy is to design roads for pedestrians and cyclists at the beginning. If this was not done, we are owed a huge debt and we ought to spend that money now. If we don't have the money for this, we're screwed. There is no class that can make cyclists unscrewed. If a motorist is going to kill you, you have no choice but to die.

"Those who cycle on the roadway and obey the rules of the road are involved in a very small
percentage of all crashes.
Of 657 daytime crashes, only 8.4% (55) involved sober cyclists who were traveling on the roadway and
were confirmed as obeying the rules of the road (6.2% of all 885 crashes). Only 15 of these (2.3% of daytime
and 1.7% of all crashes) involved overtaking motorists. Two of the 15 resulted in incapacitating injuries.
Of 196 night-time crashes, only 8.2% (16) involved sober cyclists who were traveling on the roadway and
were confirmed as obeying the rules of the road. Of these, only three were confirmed as being equipped with
lights."

This is highly irrelevant to those people like me who are, gasp, not perfect. Sorry to break your bubble, but if being perfect equals being safe, under our present regime, I'm screwed. I'm not going to become perfect. There's no way that can happen because it's impossible. 

"The 17 cyclist fatalities during the study period were associated predominantly with darkness and
intoxication. Eight of the crashes occurred at night, with none of the cyclists confirmed as having lights; one
crash occurred at dusk. In eight of the crashes the cyclist was confirmed as being intoxicated with either alcohol
or drugs, and two more were reported as “Had Been Drinking.” One crash involved an intoxicated motorist and
a second motorist “Had Been Drinking.” "

Ah, no lights. Well, guess what? IN CIVILIZED COUNTRIES THINGS ARE LIT UP AT NIGHT. That's right, in the ghetto in Philly, it was lit up so it was safe to cycle without lights. So basically Orlando acts like a totally poor or cheap person who doesn't even care enough to light things up a little bit. Instead they'll just let their citizens die and then blame them. Great job! 

Only when I went on the road where there's no expectation that every corn field will have flood lights did I buy bicycle lights. I have them in San Diego where many places are pitch black because the city is built around the car so things are spread out and they can't make enough tax money for decent lights. If they had made a normal city instead of believing in cheap oil forever, we'd have a well lit city like any other non-cheap skate city.

Instead, we kill cyclists then blame them for not buying lights. 

Guess what? Lights fail. Batteries die. So basically, I should get the death penalty if my batteries fail.

Doesn't seem right to me.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[More on the POS Orlando paper. See older posts for details.

Here's a quote:

"Those who cycle on the roadway and obey the rules of the road are involved in a very small
percentage of all crashes.
Of 657 daytime crashes, only 8.4% (55) involved sober cyclists who were traveling on the roadway and
were confirmed as obeying the rules of the road (6.2% of all 885 crashes). Only 15 of these (2.3% of daytime
and 1.7% of all crashes) involved overtaking motorists. Two of the 15 resulted in incapacitating injuries.
Of 196 night-time crashes, only 8.2% (16) involved sober cyclists who were traveling on the roadway and
were confirmed as obeying the rules of the road. Of these, only three were confirmed as being equipped with
lights."

Note that this is meaningless data.

As VCers are quick to point out this kind of data is misleading because we don't know how many people ride VC.

I say that pretty much nobody does this dangerous, confrontational, and idiotic activity.

I know this because I don't see anyone doing this. I wave to every cyclist. It's a red letter day when I see someone riding VC.

Today, I did see someone riding VC, a twelve year old in a semi-pedestrianized area next to the school that I live by. She looked about twelve or so. No helmet so VIOLATION! Also, she had a toddler on her top tube so VIOLATION. :)

Seriously, why the double standard on not having the denominator for these studies? Why post data at all if it's meaningless?

Oh, that's right, they ALWAYS post data when it proves their point. The microscope only comes out when they disagree. Note that this is normal human behavior. I do it to. I see myself doing it!

One more thing. While looking at this table, I see that only four out of seventeen cyclists died in bike lanes, sidewalks AND shoulders combined. The vast majority of cyclists died in the roadway (11/17). Thus, this data speaks volumes on how riding in the roadway is deadly. We can talk about alcohol and lights till we're blue, but the point is that not riding in the roadway is the most reliable way to mitigate this obvious danger.

  <title>New Charity of the Year: Bikes to Semis Program</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Now here's a new idea, let's get all these idiot cyclists off the road.

Now I know that there are a lot people who really, really hate cyclists who run stop signs and red lights and so on.

As of now, the only thing stopping them is a certain death when they get hit by a car.

Since the death penalty isn't working, the next logical step is for the state to hire people to sit around and watch for cyclists who didn't put their foot on the ground so they can write a bill on a piece of paper. Yes, a small fine is a MUCH huger deterrent than the normal death penalty built into our modern roads. :)

But I think we can do better than that.

Let's get the government out of the "bike running the stop sign business" and let a private charity pick up the slack. Like Bush and the Tea Bagger Co. would like it.

My suggestion is that to stop cyclists from riding all together by buying them cars.

Not ordinary cars, nobody likes those. Let's get them some SUVs, Hummers, and even a couple of Semis.

Problem solved. 

Don't you feel safer now that we have all those scofflaw cyclists behind the wheels of semis?

Because we know that people who take chances with their lives, when given an armored vehicle, will magically become model citizens!

Here's a testimonial.

"Climbing into that massive Semi where I could barely see the ground was like a baptism. Now that I was totally free from any chance of harm, I realized that I should obey every single traffic law. I don't text. Heck, I don't even listen to the radio nor talk to passengers while driving because these are all known distractions which kill thousands of people each year.

Thanks, Bikes to Semis!"]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[More and more often, I see people make similar posts to my own thoughts. Many of them write them down differently or even better than I do:

The law needs is a little personal responsibility. Once people are made responsible for the damage they do, most of them will start being careful. I will never understand why crashing into someone's car isn't treated the same as bashing it with a baseball bat or why injuring someone in a car accident isn't treated the same as injuring them in a bar fight.

In this day and age, there are few acceptable excuses for getting in an accident. 1. Unexpected equipment failure. 2. Act of nature. That's it. That's the list. Every other accident someone is at fault, often both. Once you get behind the wheel, you are operating a dangerous piece of machinery. (Unless, of course, you did not intentionally get behind the wheel...) Drivers ought to accept that responsibility for what it is.

If the law were updated in this way, we wouldn't need to micromanage all of these different laws that vary from state to state depending on whether you are drunk, stoned, on the phone, texting, using an earpiece, not using an earpiece, doing your nails, reading the newspaper, or whatever other excuses/reasons for driving badly people have. There is precedent for this. If an infant drowns in a bathtub or a kid shoots someone with a gun, the parents are criminally responsible.

Also, there's a really nice response to this:

@movement
I will never understand why crashing into someone's car isn't treated the same as bashing it with a baseball bat or why injuring someone in a car accident isn't treated the same as injuring them in a bar fight.

Because we have built a society in which cars are "absolutely necessary" so we think we can't punish people by taking away their ability to drive as that means they can't do anything (get to work, go to the store, etc.) Also, since we're so car-centric, deaths are seen as an unfortunate but necessary consequence, and are also often blamed on the deceased (e.g. if a pedestrian is killed they shouldn't have been in the way; they are different and abnormal because they're not driving so they are to blame).

  <title>Another Study Shows that Bike Lanes are Safe</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[http://journals.lww.com/jtrauma/Abstract/2012/02000/A_comparative_study_of_bike_lane_injuries.20.aspx

We know that we can't judge anything by a single study.

However, this study suggests that bike lanes are NOT super dangerous like the VC crowd says. Bike lanes do get more people biking and despite the fact that more "fearful" people are riding bikes, they are not getting any more hurt than those who are timid and do not "assert their right to the road."

Thus, there is a justification for more bike lanes.

Additionally, the higher traffic flow that some VC people claim that bike lanes cause did not seem to cause more injuries.

Injuries due to getting hit by a car are higher and I did not see any incidence of fatalities. It's a known fact that in many cities the fatalities are much higher on the roadway than on sidewalks, bike lanes, and the shoulder combined.

Finally, the door zone, which seems like an added risk did not seem to injure cyclists more than them being rear ended.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I so loved this post:

http://flyingpigeon-la.com/2012/07/privatize-this/

It's been saying what I have been trying to say, but better.

"Yet cycling in particular is the most efficient of all transport modes: not just because it uses less energy per passenger-mile than even walking does, but because it takes up so little space, and requires so little capital investment in general, that providing for mobility through cycling is the cheapest of all the ways you can spend tax money on transport."

Compare and contrast to this drivel:

"The vestiges of what’s to come are seen through (non)organizations like Anonymous, licensed driverless cars, and cyborgs in the Olympics; but we are just at the tip of the iceberg.
It seems like everyone who's not a "bike nut" really does not promote cycling at all even if they are green or futuristic."

I think that's because bicycling is not sexy.

In one sense, cyclists, once cleaned up, are sexier. However, I mean that the whole idea of cycling is so old and obvious that most people don't see it as something that they need to talk about. It's "old news" in our news cycle.

So instead of a simple bicycle, they are wasting money on "driverless cars". 

The future is here and the answers are obvious, and I think that makes things no fun which is why there's not more talk of cycling as transportation.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Anti-Helmet Advocacy: What it is and What is not</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/07/19/anti-helmet-advocacy-what-it-is-and-what-is-not/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[LTRs know that I am anti-helmet. That strikes many people as strange. It should not. Here's an FAQ.

1. It is NOT telling people what to do.

If you want to wear a helmet, I will not tell you not to wear one. I might mock you, though.

2. It is NOT putting people at greater risk.

This is because people all ready know to wear a helmet. This information has been around ever since we got the technology to make helmets that were light enough to be useless. That's right, in many cases, riding with helmets is useless. If helmet advocates really walked their walk, they'd advocate for better standards for helmets rather than telling people what they all ready know.

Also, some people take more chances when wearing helmets. I do. Also, motorists give less space to helmeted riders which raises the question "do helmets actually increase some risks of cycling and put riders at risk."

I don't really know the answers to those questions. Nobody does. Unlike those who tell everyone to wear a helmet, it's safe for me to admit ignorance. If helmets are proven safer, great, wear one. I still won't.

Most pro-helmet people won't even CONSIDER that helmets could be more risky. The fact that helmets are safer is taken on faith alone.

3. It is NOT equivalent to arguing against seat belts.

People feel safe inside a car even without a seatbelt. They feel in danger on a bicycle even with a helmet.

But there's more!

People choose to drive a car because they feel that they have to. Making then take a few minor, extra steps is no big deal for mode share.

On the other hand, riding a bicycle is seen as something dangerous and freakish. Anything that makes it even more alienating from something normal will make it less popular.

Since cycling is beneficial, taking a benefit away hurts people's health more than the imaginary, yet to be established, benefits of wearing a helmet.

4. Advocating for helmets is NOT something cycling advocates should do.

This was probably addressed above, but I'll re-iterate.

Yes, we should try to make cycling conditions safer, but there has never been a successful campaign in favor of cycling that rested messing up your hair as a main benefit to cycling.

Helmet advocates over estimate the risk for head injury that cycling has and they have convinced an entire generation or two that cycling is "taking your life in your own hands."

The fact that you need protective equipment to do it makes it look very foolish.

Making an activity look dangerous and foolish is not a way to advocate for cycling.

If you get more people to cycle, like I said, they'll wear helmets IF THEY WANT TO. BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP PREACHING TO PEOPLE WHO ALL READY KNOW BETTER.

We all know that not wearing a helmet makes us an organ donor. But did you know that wearing a helmet makes you look like a dork?

I'd rather get cut up for spare parts right now than spend the rest of my life cowering beneath a useless piece of plastic that anti-cyclists have convinced me to wear to make motorists feel better about themselves.]]></content:encoded>

My argument of him "Needing to learn how to fall under control" is a moot point.  If we go on longer trail rides I'll slap a lid on him, mostly to avoid people fussing about it
You bring up some good points that are sadly lost on our hyper-safe-obssessed society.  Simply throwing a lid on does not make you a safer rider!]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[OK, LIKE BEFORE, I FOLLOW ALL TRAFFIC LAWS ON MY BICYCLE AND I RECOMMEND IT (but only on this blog).

However, I do not think that scofflaw cyclists is a significant problem.

Are they annoying? Yes, they are an annoyance, but not a problem. Like flies (in the US)--they are a problem in other countries, true. Sure a fly kills a person or two in the US, but overall, they are minor nuisance. Very, very annoying, but something that need to be swatted on an individual basis, in most cases.

If fact, we know that the whole phrase scofflaw cyclist is biased, and it's there for an anti-cycling agenda.

Normal and sane advocates want us all to behave better so that we increase happiness, courtesy, and decrease collisions especially harmful ones.

Targeting a specific group which causes a lesser amount of harm is a total waste of resources.

Like I said before, if you mess up on a bicycle, you very well may get the death penalty. While this is true with motoring, the danger is much more apparent on a bicycle which in my opinion is a good thing. Getting comfortable causes one to take more risks.

So before we burn millions more public dollars at the altar of the few people who have an unbalanced hatred of cyclists, let's rather focus on bigger problems.

If we are to ban one class of vehicles from the roads, I vote for larger trucks because they kill the most number of people.

This notion is called triage where we deal with the bigger and easier problems.

Once we have roadway deaths down to a dozen or so, we can focus on those evil scofflaws that kill a pedestrian two if we are unlucky.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Once again, a head nod to Ted for writing my blog for me:

http://bikinginla.wordpress.com/2012/07/18/fontana-bolo-alert-memorial-services-for-veluz-abraham-and-yet-another-pro-rider-lets-us-down/

Every time a "journalist" sits down to write about cycling, uniformed garbage comes out of his word processor:

http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-07-18/opinion/os-ed-highway-cyclists-071812-20120717_1_bike-friendly-cycling-bike-paths-and-lanes

If you hate bikes, that's fine. I can live with that.

But why do you have to spew stupid, uninformed rants?

Here's my favorite quote:

"We encourage bike-friendly communities and back bike paths and lanes. But, to paraphrase MetroPlanner Bob Dallari, we're not willing to spend outrageous sums to build death traps."

What?

Almost every road in Orlando is too big and thus overpriced.

They are all death traps as Orlando is the deadliest city when it comes to cycling.

So they shouldn't build any roads at all, I guess according to this mindless drivel.

It gets worse.

They want to enforce the ban on cycling on the freeways!

What?

And do what? Build cycle tracks?

They are talking about a million dollars. They don't seem to say how much freeway this is going to be, but they call it a "pretty penny"? Really? Compared with what?

Did they actually like at how microscopically small the amount is when it compares to building roads for cars.

It's a little insulting and petty to OK billions for making the roads more dangerous for cycling and then bitch and moan about a few crumbs falling from the budgetary table.

Like I wrote about before, I rode on the freeway WITHOUT SPECIAL ROAD TREATMENTS and it was fine. At night. It felt safer then the shroads that I was forced on, previously, because the quiet roads are all selfish cul-de-sacs.

If they put a million bucks on the 15 freeway, I'd take it, daily to work. I'd get to work faster. The only down side is less hills.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Jump on the (Rad) Wagon for Good Critiques</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Finally, we get a great critique of <a href="http://radwagon.blogspot.com/2012/07/wet-weather-riding.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Radwagon+%28RadWagon%29">cycling infrastructure!</a>

For years, I have felt that the microscopic views of VC advocates could be a tremendous asset to making cycling infrastructure better and safer.

But instead of focusing on ridability of the infrastructure we get bizarre reading of laws and standards as well as fear-mongering which is intended to squash infrastructure all together.

This has polarised the community and put the pro-infrastructure camp on edge because any small problem we have with infrastructure will be seized upon the the VC camp and used to squash it all together.

This means that we have to swallow shit "improvements" like sharrows.

No longer. Rad Wagon has tossed down the gauntlet in a well written post. I'd like to see much more quality critiques like this which includes highly inexpensive and super-simple solutions.

Thanks for making the point that infrastructure itself is a good idea, but it's usually done half-assed in the US.

The way out is better infrastructure. But thanks to our neighbourhood Quislings, we are about thirty years behind with shit infrastructure to fulfilled the self-fulfilling prophesies of doom.

  <title>What is NEC?</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[NEC is a word that I just made up.

It stands for Net Expenditure per Citizen for transporation.

What?

For too long, we have been playing the Penny Wise Game (penny wise, pound foolish for those who need it).

This means that we are asking the wrong questions over, and over again.

Can we afford a bike lane? Can we afford a bullet train. And so on.

Each "alternative" aka more efficient and fun form of trasporation needs to crawl through glass just to get considered for funding while we always have another trillion dollars or two for more roads that we won't be able to pay for.

There has to be a better way.

There is, and it's called NEC. Basically, this means that we need to look at the average of what everyone will spend on transporation. We need to account for ALL modes and ALL costs. Price each parking lot, for example. Currently, San Diego doesn't even _know_ how many spots that they own. 

Then we can figure out how much each transporation project is going to save us. That's right, save, not cost.

For example, we might pay a bit more for a good bus service, but now they don't have to build a parking spot for me, and I don't need to own and operate an auto. Plus, we don't build that extra travel lane. Ultimately, with increased taxes, even, my net costs go down.

But you can't do just you which is why it's an AVERAGE.

So we have each person, selishly, and foolishly only thinking of what they will pay for transporation NOW. They discount things that they think are free like parking and their sunk cost of buying a car. 

This is bad math.

No wonder our city budget is so messed up if we can't even do proper counting of basic things.

Until we get a better hold on the NEC for the city NOW, it's foolish to even talk about spending a single cent on any more lanes or parking spots.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Smeed's Lanes</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Note, I'm not going to try to pretend to be a traffic engineer nor any other kind of expert.

However, I thought it might be nice to through some ideas out there.

In 1949, Smeed put forth a formula for determining a few things related to traffic. For this post, I'll just deal with congestion:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smeed%27s_law

Basically, the notion is this:

"He said that the average speed of traffic in central London would always be nine miles per hour, because that is the minimum speed that people will tolerate...He noted that at some minimum speed, motorists would simply choose not to drive. If speeds fell below 9 mph, then drivers would keep away; as speeds rose above this limit, it would draw more drivers out until the roads became congested again."

Thus, adding extra lanes would not help to reduce congestion.

So why add lanes?

There are many reasons for that, but one thing is certain and that is that we don't always build things for rational reasons.

Another idea is that often roadway development is pushed by developers who have an investment in land on the other end of the road. If you look into the building of roads, you'll see that developers are often the ones who are in favor of more roads.

Developers, as a group, are not bad people, but like every other human they are self-interested. They are used to dealing with the public who is irrational. So how to sell a road that will make you rich? If I were a developer, I wouldn't talk about how much money I were to make, but rather how we would help the "public" by "reducing congestion and reducing trip times."

Thus, when you see these claims, they may legitimate. Many people think that reducing congestion is a the noblest of human goals and it outweighs our peace, environment, enjoyment, air quality, and health.

However, Smeed showed us that in many cases, we will NOT reduce congestion by making a road bigger especially as bigger roads often equal more development and thus more traffic associated with it.

So let's not kid ourselves. We can build bigger roads to make developers rich, and in many cases, we should do this. But let's not be full of shit when it comes to reducing congestion.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey, Steve, thanks for agreeing.

It's kind of funny how in today's world these kinds of findings have been relegated, by the media and uneducated public, to points of view rather than findings.

I actually do get 9 MPH. I think that there is much, much denial on how fast most cars go in the minds of motorists. I don't know how fast they go, but I'd like to see some data. Perhaps with new gps devices and the like, we can get some of this info for ourselves aka total distance / total trip time.

I think people may be surprised.

Overall, I think that if motorists see open road and few stops they are happy despite their actual travel speed. This explains why they often fight things that will increase accessibility and decrease trip times.

Cheers.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Mindfulness Cycling 1/14</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Mindfulness Cycling 1/14

This is part one of a series that I will never complete as I don't really like to finish these things. Plus there's some trainings that are really tough for me so I ignore them like the one about TV and alcohol which Buddha would tell me were my refuge because they are.

http://deerparkmonastery.org/mindfulness-practice/the-fourteen-mindfulness-trainings

Still, this material is very powerful to me and helpful while I ride so I thought I'd share how I connect Buddhism to cycling.

The First Mindfulness Training: Openness

Note that I am really open when it comes to learning new things about cycling and when I am actually cycling.

Otherwise, I am becoming more and more close minded when it comes to dealing with fanatics because the in those situations, the open-minded person always loses. I can't sit there passively accepting all their nonsense without doing some research on my own. Also, I won't submit to so-called "experts" views especially if they can't spell xpert. :)

Anyway, here's some text:

"Aware of the suffering created by fanaticism and intolerance, we are determined not to be idolatrous about or bound to any doctrine, theory, or ideology, even Buddhist ones."

I take this to mean that I need to be open to cycling in any condition. Any unhelpful phrase regarding cycling should be ignored. 

"It's too hot/cold to cycle."

"I need a fancy bike path before I can bike to work."

"Bike paths are death traps and I can't ride in them."

"Blah, blah, blah."

I jump on my bicycle in any conditions and ride. If I can't get there by bicycle, I usually don't go.

Also, the statement means that sometimes I have to just let things go even if I think that it's the wrong view.

On the road, I have to keep in mind that I might be wrong about my "rights" or "right of way". Kindness is more important to me than rights.

Here's some more gold:

"We understand that fanaticism in its many forms is the result of perceiving things in a dualistic and discriminative manner."

I have noticed that this is really true. There are many other ways that we get confused and misperceive things. I think that too many abstractions hurt one's understanding as well as deleting information from our mind's that we don't like. Finally, there are many ways to distort reality in our mind's.

Thus, I try to see things as they are. Where do people bicycle and why? When people tell me things, I try to take them as they are without making up unnecessary stories about what they say.

Needless to say, I'm not bound by any of this at all as I'm not actually a Buddhist. But these things do make me happier and they make the day go nicer so I love to read and think about them especially while cycling.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Helmet Redux: A Repost</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[You really have to read this <a href="http://waronthemotorist.wordpress.com/2012/08/02/all-those-helmets-posts-in-one-place/">fantastic post on helmets.</a>

I just started, but it's really worth it. Here's a taste:

"Because the interesting aspect of helmet research is not so much how they affect your chances surviving an accident, but how they affect your chances of having an accident.  It all comes back to how road users behave, and there are reasons to believe that helmet use could change people’s behaviour in a way that increases the accident rate."

I wrote about this earlier, but here's an even better breakdown especially of the scienfitic framework that one needs before one can even say what "safe" means.

Thank-you, thank-you so much!

I feel a little less alone now.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I get this one mixed up with number one as it seems like another rehash of it:

The Second Mindfulness Training: Non-Attachment to Views

This is from the excellent <a href="http://deerparkmonastery.org/mindfulness-practice/the-fourteen-mindfulness-trainings">Deer Park, of course.</a>

The first training says: "Aware of the suffering created by fanaticism and intolerance, we are determined not to be idolatrous about or bound to any doctrine, theory, or ideology, even Buddhist ones."

While the second one says: "Aware of the suffering created by attachment to views and wrong perceptions, we are determined to avoid being narrow-minded and bound to present views."

I like both of them, though, and it doesn't bother me to rehash things.

I do see myself caught up in useless views all the time, like the notion that helmets are useless when some studies say that they are. Also, my obsession with infrastructure can cloud my mind on how cycling, right now, is the third best thing ever! I do love my commute to work.

We all need to realize that our views are not the end all and be all. On the other hand, we need _some_ intellectual framework to work in.

"We are aware that the knowledge we presently possess is not changeless, absolute truth. Insight is revealed through the practice of compassionate listening, deep looking, and letting go of notions rather than through the accumulation of intellectual knowledge."

I love this part because it pretty much precludes the notion of the "expert" who knows everything. 

I also love how compassion is combined with learning; I seldom hear this in other context; this is great!

Finally, this spoke the most to me: "Truth is found in life, and we will observe life within and around us in every moment, ready to learn throughout our lives."

I thought, "yes!"

So many people have so many notions on how to cycle, but they don't do it! I think that one needs to cycle all the time before one has a valid opinion on cycling.

Truth is found in life, indeed, and not in our armchairs.

I hope to give up even more fixed views in the next year.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>BDS: Bicycle Derangement Syndrome</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a disorder found in the uneducated who feel that anything associated with cycling is automatically politically charged and dangerous.

Take any case and add a bicycle and people go nuts!

Example, last year, I was merging into traffic that was all but stopped. There were lots of cars a motorist's way doing crazy shit. I signal to merge and she freaks out on me. Look, lady, there's trucks that'll pulverize your car, but if you want to waste your energy on me, well, that's BDS.

Or if there are kids running in the street to an SUV--true story--the mom was OK with that. Then I slow down to pass the SUV and "WAAAAATCH OUT FOR THAT BIKE!!" No mention of all the insane traffic that was coming out of the blind spot beneath the arch on the Prado. Just the insane bike which was all ready slowing down to avoid getting hit by kids or SUV.

Or if there's tons and tons of traffic laws being broken: a stop sign being treated like NASCAR starting gate, and suddenly I STOP next to a car which rolls a stop sign then I keep going. Who gets harassed? The cyclist because he didn't put his foot on the ground.

If a car hits a pedestrian, the ped is "jaywalking" but a cycle hits and pedestrian and we need a crack down.

Cars, driving into gas stations and parking lots, routinely ride on the sidewalk at high speeds. Yet there's NO ban on sidewalk driving only on sidewalk riding which is annoying, but much less dangerous.

If someone gets hit by a car and they are on a bicycle, they are immediately suspected of "being in the way" or some of nonsense no matter what the facts are. While a cyclist bleeds to death there are all ready calls of taking action against the "scofflaw cyclist".

Any time I take an overnight bike ride for camping, I am immediately questioned about what political cause I'd like to further. It just "makes sense" to see nature in an artificial box.

Any law or legal help for cyclists is immediately assumed to be far left wing, part of the Democratic party, the EU, and yes, even a Communist Plot. Do the same thing in a care, and it's a-OK.

There are many other examples, but now we have the terminology for it. Remember she who argues quickest argues best. And we are reduced to three letters.

BDS (bicycle derangement syndrome) and BBF (blame bicycles first) forever!!]]></content:encoded>

  <title>How to use experts -- and when not to</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, I watched a great talk, which, again reshashes some of my older ideas, but this time, it has the endorsement of experts! (That is with an 'E'--hi, John). ;)

<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/noreena_hertz_how_to_use_experts_and_when_not_to.html">How to use experts and when not to.</a>

This was helpful for me because it answered a question that I have had for a long time. How come, unlike many places in Europe, people's mere opinions were taken for fact on the relative safety of infrastructure? Why were studies not done to improve road design.

Here it seems, there's a cult of an expert. As we see, going forward, there continues to be a cult of experts who take their own opinions and create paper certifications for them. This goes for all bike safety programs as well as the gray bearded bike xperts who, routinely, squash infrastructure with vague promises of death and lawsuits. 

Why are their obviously stupid and untested opinions seen as fact?

MRI studies show that when listening to self-proclaimed experts, the part of the human mind that discriminates turns off.

This is very bad. 

The talk goes on to say how we need to question the cult of experts with calls for objective proof. Archane language should be translated into normal English speech.

What are the assumptions behind the research? What is your investigation focused on?

Managed dissent is the active engagement with people who disagree. It's like seeking out and cultivating discussions and professional relationships with those in the other camp. This is brilliant! And hard to do.

I recall how scared I feel to post an opinion on a transportation blog even when I know that they are open to my ideas. Why? Because of the crushing uniformity of thought and the verbally violent attacks on any heretic who thinks that the government is more than an agent out to hurt cycling, and anyone who thinks that the built environment can easily and practically be made safer.

I can hear it now, "Mr. Unbound, don't you fancy yourself an expert?"

I think well of myself, of course, however, I do think that there is always more to know. I think that the best infrastructure has NOT even been built yet! I am open to a magic way of riding one's bicycle that defies physics and human psychology to actually make one safer. I will continue to read crash stats, to read studies, and to propose my own experiments.

That I have no education in cycling does not make me any smarter than those who do--education by the way means from an ACCREDITED univeristy, not some fly by night "safety expert" with made up certifications. I know transportation engineers and they talk of bicycle safety much differently than those who think you can get everyone to magically ride safer.

Also, we must be fearless to bring in heretical ideas. New knowledge not only comes from new ideas but from the destruction of old ideas. The more dissent we open ourselves to, the smarter we get.

So go out there and read _Effective Cycling_ and _Cycle Craft_.

Overall, the most important part of her talk was the notion of MANAGED dissent. Too often VCers speak more often and more loudly to drown out the rest. 

Thus, I am open to all ideas on increasing cycling popularity, but what good are the views who don't share this goal?

As for safety, I feel that VCers can play an excellent role in criticizing and improving road design, but they fail to help us due to their fixed and superstitious belief that road design can NEVER make cycling safer unless we can mix it up with fast cars.

This is why, initially, I have begun to clam up and to keep them out of my mind and my life. Because most of it is the same stuff over and over again.

The Unbound household had obsessed over and psychoanalyzed the VC luminaries, and it all turns out to be a rear guard attempt by them to protect their bad decisions and thus their egos.

There are a new generation of Vehicular Cyclists--or whatever name they are re-branding themselves this week--and they do have some great, fresh ideas that I am open to.

I have watched one talk, and I'll keep my eye on them.

Thus, in this spirit, I'd like to see new, radical ideas on transportation safety wit the emphasis on NEW.

  <title>Helmets: Waste of Energy?</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Here's a <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00036941.htm">stupid post (CDC).</a>

There are lots of facts here, but in my own confirmational methods, I have found only two salient facts.

One, what is likelihood, of those with brain injury, of being on a biycle at the time of injury?

Seven. That's percent.

Thus, you are much more likely than NOT to have a head injury when NOT riding a bicycle! This means that instead of mandatory cycling helmet laws, I feel you should only have to wear a helmet when NOT riding a bike because you are more likely to come to harm. This is pretty obvious enough to be argued to death by those who don't get stats.

Second, if you are on a bicyle and die, what's the chance that a motor vehicle was involved? Ninety percent.

Again, most likely to die by getting hit by a car. Quick, from this page, what does the CDC not care about? That's right, the deadliest thing to cyclists. No care for that, zero concern on making cars slow down or stop them all together from hitting us. 

Instead the tired request that we legislate a piece of stupid plastic on our heads.

Finally, the talked about standards for cycling helmets. For one, I don't think that most helmets are of the Snell standard which is for motorcycle helmets. Second, even motor bike helmets are mostly useless in high speed collisions, the ones we actually care about because they are the ones that maim and kill. Most of high speed head injury is INSIDE the head not outside due to decelleration. NO HELMET can save you from inertia in your own head.

  <title>Prerequisites For Enforcing Traffic Laws</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/08/10/prerequisites-for-enforcing-traffic-laws/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[We all know that as cyclists, we should always follow the traffic laws. But there are many cases when this is hard or impossible to do so. For example, in many places there is a magic sensor that easily detects cars, but it's a black art to make them work with a bicycle--when they detect bikes at all.

Thus, _before_ we ticket another cyclists and slander her good name with scofflaw, it only makes sense that the framework for her to practically follow the laws is in place.

Here's my plan:

1. All lights are timed. No more sensors. Now cyclists can wait knowing that eventually they will get the light. Activating sensors is too hard and often requires us to go to places in the lane we don't want to be in. So let us stay in our "bike lane" and out of the way.

2. Tickets should hurt and should thus be proportional. To make things easier to get a "fair" amount for a ticket: traffic fines are increased to the list cost of resale value of the vehicle that broke them. After all people drive expensive vehicles to show how wealthy they are. It makes sense that they should be treated as wealthy as they present themselves. :)

3. In streets where there are two or more lanes, instead of useless "Use full lane" twaddle, we actually enforce a speed limit of fifteen miles per hour in the left lane, only. This is now the "bike lane", shared lane, or whatever else we want to call it. Fines for speeding are priced at point two above.

No education is needed just lots of enforcement which will now pay for itself. No lines or signs are needed, just a few media announcements.

With these simple changes, cycling without breaking the laws will actually be possible for the first time.]]></content:encoded>

On my old commute, I even had to trigger things for motorcyclists on occasion. Come to Texas and I'll teach you the "secret handshake." It's good stuff to know between now and the time all lights are timed.

Or wait until the end of next week and I'll redo my blog labels so you can simply search "traffic light." I've been needing to tweak the labels anyway...]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Mindfulness Cycling 3/14</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://deerparkmonastery.org/mindfulness-practice/the-fourteen-mindfulness-trainings">The Third Mindfulness Training: Freedom of Thought</a>

"Aware of the suffering brought about when we impose our views on others, we are determined not to force others, even our children, by any means whatsoever – such as authority, threat, money, propaganda, or indoctrination – to adopt our views."

For this one, I'm not too bad, I don't think.

I don't tell people what to wear nor how to ride their bikes. Heck, I try to avoid giving advice at all, and I don't even like to help people.

I will answer people's questions honestly, though. I will help people, if asked in how to choose a first bike and so on, but only to not be a total asshole.

Of course, I am obsessed with all things VC, and this reminds me of them to a T.

I know I am guilty of asking cyclists not to praise VCness and I did implore people to not hurt one another and to follow traffic laws. So for this, I am guilty.

The main thing, for us, is seeing if this can help us to be better humans and cyclists. I can see how I can give up my views on the Law and on clothing.

Perhaps lycra and helmets are really hot and sexy? Perhaps sexy is bad and I should aspire to look like a dork? Perhaps I am losing my mind with this mindfulness.

Overall, to quote Husker Du, I don't know for sure.

Here's more mindful goodness:

"We are committed to respecting the right of others to be different, to choose what to believe and how to decide. We will, however, learn to help others let go of and transform fanaticism and narrowness through loving speech and compassionate dialogue."

Did I tell that person how to live at my last ride? No, I was focused on mindfulness of the body during cycling.

So overall, this one is pretty easy. I know that it precludes many of my screeds, and these, my friend, I'm NOT ready to give up. Not even for enlightenment.

Long live silly mockery! :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>More Media Driven Hatred (which can be seen as funny)</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Over time, I am trying (operative word is trying) not to take cars, and traffic and cycling communting too seriously.

Here's an example of the opposite.

It's funny the same way that Chaplin's, The Dictator, is funny. Pompous, self-important people who try to impose themselves on others are hilarious:

http://www.marinatimes.com/2012/07/another-bicyclist-behaving-badly/

"I stopped at a four-way sign, looked all directions, and proceeded into the intersection. Out of nowhere, a bicyclist flew through the stop sign to my left, riding right in front of me, forcing me to slam on the brakes. I came inches from hitting him, but he didn’t notice."

So she basically almost killed someone and they didn't notice! If only I had such equanimity when my life is threatened.

Note that I do NOT endorse breaking of traffic laws in any way. Know your laws and follow them at all times while riding your bicycle. (Hello Homeland Security).

"As he pedaled along the right side of the street, I pulled up next to his rickety bike, rolled down my window, and said, “You have to stop at stop signs just like cars do.”"

Haha, funny begins. She almost kills someone who was stupid enough to break a traffic law. Now she's lecturing him like he's a child. I bet he's going to take that well.

I wonder if she tracks down motorists who roll stop signs and lectures them, too. Hmmm.

Then he flips her off spits on her, etc. He's an asshole who does not represent me. My goal in these cases is to dismount and walk my bicycle. I'll offer any motorist a free coffee so we can discuss the relative merits of traffic laws and the responsibilities of motorists who feel that they need to lecture us on safety.

But it gets better:

"I felt my Sicilian blood boiling as I kept pace with him. “Why is it you think you’re exempt from the law?” "

My the hell does she feel the need to tail this guy? Pass him and leave him alone. He's a crazy person.

"Suddenly and without warning, like the snake that he was, Curly whipped his head around and spit at me from the passenger side."

Haha, there was a HUGE warning. Lecturing someone, especially someone who totally disregards the law is going to get you attacked in many cases. DUH! Also, notice how she dehumanizes him with a derogatory label?

Yes, he is crazy and mean, but he's probably a human. I can't be sure as I was not there.

This is what really made me laugh:

"As I hosed Curly’s disgusting spit wads off my windows, I realized he was right about one thing: there was nothing I could do about it. Had he been in a car, I could have gotten his license plate number, but on a bicycle, he was as anonymous as he was arrogant."

Really?

You think that if a motorist runs a stop sign, I catch him and lecture him and he spits on me the police are going to take the plate number and do what?

This is so, so funny.

What a poor victim we have here:

1. She almost killed someone, yes, she didn't mean to, that's nice, but one of the reasons I try not to drive is that I fear I will kill someone. That's my choice. She made her choice. Did she think that motoring was without risks or something?

2. She lectured someone as if they were a child.

3. She chased them down and continued to berate him.

4. She called him spineless while hiding in her car.

Overall, I see two people who have no manners. But notice that the article is written in a manner to fan the flames between the Big and Small Enders? I mean motorists and cyclists--people will find small reasons to hate one another.

I realize that people lose their temper all the time, but I suggest that later on. when we are cool headed to stop penning articles which promote misunderstanding, dehumanization, caricaturization, and hate.

I can forgive road rage, but not hate mongering.

(At least not yet.) :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Why Cycling is Vital</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The idea out there is that the whole point of cycling infrastructure is to get the government to spend good money on the sport and hobby of the very few.

This view is highly wrong for several reasons.

First of all, due to the Tea Party, we are all about efficiency and saving money. Cycling solves five vital needs in the most cost efficient manner.

These needs are: transportation, health, safety, cost savings and fun.

First of all, transportation by bicycle is the most efficient in terms of money and time. 

The only barrier for it is the massive amount of government spending on infrastructure that impedes cycling.

That's right, it's not that we need money for cycling, it's that we need money to mitigate the problems that government spending and regulations have caused. This costs pennies on the dollar for cycling compared with other transportation.

The big impediments for people cycling are: the dangers of high speed traffic, lack of direct cycling routes, the vast amount of space that's wasting on parking and inefficient zoning.

Government created the problem, but government is the only possible solution as they still control the roads and zoning regulations that hold us back.

Motoring is highly, highly inefficient. It has sucked up almost one hundred percent of the federal budget for decades. What do they have to show for it? When you speak to a motorist, you only hear complaints about not enough parking and too much congestion. When will things be perfect? How many more billions before we get it right?

Give cycling the motoring money, for a year, and we'll never need that much money again. Transportation costs, per average person will go down, forever.

Second is safety. Motoring kills the most number of people. That's a fact. If one percent of the population drove and the rest rode bicycles, there would be far fewer deaths by traffic incidents. Cycling accidents are much less lethal when a motor vehicle is not involved. Again, most motoring deaths occur to those INSIDE a car.

Again, we don't wish to promote cycling rather we wish the government spend less money promoting motoring.

This will also help with national security. Think of the traffic jams during the hurricane Katrina. If all those refugees were on bicycles, the traffic tie up would not have occurred and lives would have been lost.

Again, we can still have motoring, when necessary, as an option. But motoring plus cycling are more efficient than motoring alone.

Third is health. This should be obvious. We have a massive health care bill each year and this would be much lower if we were healthier. Cycling helps with some of the more expensive costs such as heart disease and diabetes each of which kill more Americans than all transportation incidents combined.

Fourth, cycling much, much less than motoring so the net cost savings for each household should be very high if the government did less to discourage cycling.

Finally, fun is more important than we think. Americans spend a great deal of their paychecks on entertainment. Cycling costs much less than many other forms of entertainment. Furthermore, it one can combine one's exercise, transportation and entertainment in one activity which is highly efficient.

Thus, cycling serves American needs in many ways. These needs are bi-partisan, there is no debate that these needs have to be served.

We should ask ourselves, should we continue to suffer higher bills, more deaths, worse health, and less fun due to an antiqued view of cycling?]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Government spending and regulation is the whole point.

Why is there a parking lot in front of IGA? I bet there are parking regulations for MOTORING only.

My plan would REDUCE government spending. 

Also, I consider hatred of the US government to be very offensive. Not totally treasonous, but border line Anti-Americanism that the Republican party, my party is doing all the time.

Why do so many Americans hate America?]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Mindfulness Cycling 4/14</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://deerparkmonastery.org/mindfulness-practice/the-fourteen-mindfulness-trainings">The Fourth Mindfulness Training: Awareness of Suffering</a>

This is something that I'm super aware of.

"We will do our best not to run away from our own suffering or cover it up through consumption but practice conscious breathing and walking to look deeply into the roots of our suffering."

I so love this one.

I'd argue that in addition to consumption of alcohol and other things, we also use our anger to run away from our suffering.

Blaming another person, even if they did something wrong, ultimately gets us off the hook from our own responsibility.

Does this mean that we should not look for justice? No, I'd argue that we should look for justice, but that's not the point of this practice.

I covered this earlier, but activism (working on the outside world) is one thing and practice is another (working on our inside world). I feel that we must focus on both worlds. If anything, we work on our outside world for other people.

But there's a time for going after criminal motorists and the like and a time to work on our internal suffering. I think that this training is focused on inside suffering.

I also would add to breathing and walking, cycling. I do a lot of good thinking on my bicycle as well as good meditations.

"We know we can only find the path leading to the transformation of suffering when we understand the roots of suffering."

According to the Buddhist practice, clinging is the root of suffering. I have found, recently, that one thing I cling to very much is the notion of fairness on the road. I been working on tossing out that notion while I'm actually riding.

Obviously, we are all still committed to justice, but in the very act of riding, I am trying not to question a motorist's actions. For example, was it fair that they passed so fast?

In their mind, YES, it was fair. So it's ridiculous to try to micro-manage other people's actions. I just have to worry about my own.

Also, I am using the double column technique from _Feeling Good_ which uses empathy to dispel anger. On one column I write down angry thoughts against the motorist. On the other, I write down my responses from the motorist's point of view. Also, reading interviews and talking to motorists also shows that they have a kind, compassionate, and fair point of view. However, they don't realize how scary they are when they try to impose this notion of fairness on people while riding in a huge missile.

They don't know, but they _should_ know. The key word here is "should" which to me, thanks to reading Albert Ellis is a big red flag. Should Statements usually lead to anger and depression when they are unquestioned and automatic. In nature, there's no reason why anyone should or should not do anything.

"Once we have understood our own suffering, we will be able to understand the suffering of others."

I loved this part because it's so true. Motorists suffer so much in so many ways. I won't itemize them here, but there's a lot of pain there.

"We are committed to finding ways, including personal contact and using the telephone, electronic, audiovisual, and other means to be with those who suffer, so we can help them transform their suffering into compassion, peace and joy."

I see that there's no notion of the middle finger on this list. :)

In general, the thing I do for these people is to leave them alone.

Again, I'm not an emotional super-hero, but some of these phrases and techniques have helped me deal with a lot of my own internal pain and they have made my riding more enjoyable.

It just keeps getting better!]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently I had a conversation with a "friend" who was trying to coerce me to buy a car.

I had made the HUGE mistake of mentioning the incident where a co-worker emailed us that he was late for because of traffic. I said that I never think that's an excuse. Well, she thought it was perfectly reasonable to be late due to traffic because it's beyond one's control. I realized that I don't think this way. I try to give myself a time buffer in case I have to make a bike repair on the way.
She thought that this was ridiculous! Well, I didn't and this started getting me thinking of a simple experiment:

I think that 50% of emails I get are based on car troubles. I almost
NEVER miss work due to bike troubles. I'll catch a ride or fix it at
lunch or something, but not on work time.

Anyway here's a recent email:

"Transmission getting bad. I’ll be out for a while getting it at least
diagnosed.  I’ll be back if I can."

Wow, I'll be back if I can.

I'd like to see a survey which compares time missed by motorists due
to car problems and cyclists due to bike troubles...

Also lateness for cycling vs. motorists. If put into the media,
perhaps a bike will be a plus for a job interview and not a black mark
against one.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Pathologies of Power and Why Cyclists are so Annoying</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I have started reading a new book which is all ready mind blowing in its insights which can be used in the cycling world.

First of all, I'd to say that I finally figured out why cyclists are so annoying. It's because they are not respected.

Imagine a car running a stop sign. Would a motorist track them down, cut them off, then lecture them? Who does this EACH TIME THERE'S A TRAFFIC VIOLATION? The person would either be in jail or dead if they did this.

So why do they feel that they can do this for cyclists? Because they don't respect us as equals.

It's because they feel that they can kill us, they feel that they have more rights and privileges.

I know that this sounds insane, and that's because it is. If someone says this out loud that is. But this is how people feel.

I think that this point has to be make more loud and clear. Motorists hate cyclists because they can kill us and thus are insulted when we don't do their will.

It's like someone holding up a bank and the staff doesn't cooperate. Instant anger on the part of the gun holder.

To say this again, cyclists are annoying because motorists think about killing us.

But we can go a step further like Paul Farmer does in _The Pathologies of Power_ where he talks about structural violence. That is violence inherent in the system. The whole notion that there are classes of transportation that can kill others is due to the way we spend money on transportation and our priorities. We talk about "safety" but only spend money on safety for motorists.

These hidden assumptions are why nothing is getting done, for the most part, for cycling in the US.

But it gets worse!

This paragraph was written about human rights groups and it works if we treat alternative transportation as a form of human right:

"Instead of being the currency of social justice or conscience-driven movement, 'human rights' has increasingly become the specialized language of a select professional cadre with its own rites of passage and methods of certification. Far from being a badge of honor, humans rights activism is, in some places I have observed, increasingly a certificate of privilege."

To put it another way, we have to demand that our transportation advocates (and planners) take the bus EVERYWHERE. Cycling advocates should cycle!

Also, it is true that if you have a good idea for transportation but you don't put it in the right language, you'll be laughed at. Worse, as I said, the system has built in violence.

One example is AASTO, the highway manual which does not plan for decent conditions for cycling and walking at all. This has become one excuse to build for motorists, only, because it's on the books. Another example is the eighty fifth percentage law for speed limits where speeding motorists determine the speed limit! Another is how the police and judges routinely turn their backs on the victims of roadway violence. Again, they hide behind the system which is designed for giving power and privilege to motorists, only.

So before you see real change, we need to change the language of how we approach the entire system.

For example, each time we spend money on motoring, it's spoken of terms of inevitability. But when talking about cycling infrastructure, its' a special favor done for us and that we some how "owe" motorists the money back.

With the support of the entire system, it's not only easy to not fund cycling, but rather it would be hard to do anything else and it would put one's career on the line.

So I think that the first thing to talk about is the enormous power and privilege that motoring has. In fact, another way of putting it is taht you must first give a ton of money to the motoring industry in order to gain access to fertile females. Romantic love and reproduction is strongly tied to petrol and the combustion engine.

This is just another way of rephrasing the myth that if you don't have a car, you can't get a date.

To sum it up, our system has given motoring incredible privilege. The thing that bothers me, though, is that this was done without speaking overtly about it and without a democratic vote.

I believe that before we give almost 100% of our transportation budget to one demographic, we should have a vote of a populace who is well versed in the pros and cons of this radical decision.

Naw, fuck it, let's just do it without asking anyone. If anyone questions this, we'll dismiss him as nuts.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>BAT: Bikes Are Toys</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This post has two inspirations.

My first goal is to get more empathy for other people and to see other people's points of view.

The second is my goal is, like Seinfield used to do, is to coin a bunch of cool catch phrases. In my case, this is stuff like BBF (blame bicyclists first).

This post is about the notion of BAT. There are many, many messages on message boards that presuppose this such as, "Let's not spend MY TAX MONEY on your hobby" and even the idea that if one had the "right to the road" on a bicycle, they should have the right to commute to work in a boat.

Putting aside the notion that commuting to work in a sailboat would be AWESOME and very green, we have to address the idea that cycling is merely a hobby.

I am a working stiff who rides his bicycle to work. I probably don't need to ride a bicycle to work, but I choose to do so.

The people who don't want me to do this are mainly of the BAT idea aka bicycles are toys.

While bicycles can be toys, they are also the most highly efficient form of transportation.

As the political and economic system, is pushing towards more efficiency, wouldn't it be nice if we enabled the _most_ efficient system to work well with other transportation modes?

In order to get over this quickly, I have adopted that BAT acronym. Now, in three letters, I can summarize the opposing point of view.

Overall, while I disagree with BAT, it's good to comprehend and to anticipate arguments against spending a tiny amount of money to make cycling a viable transportation system for all who choose to do so.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I loved this<a href="http://waronthemotorist.wordpress.com/2012/08/08/the-definition-of-madness/"> link </a>.

At War with the Motorist is one of the best cycling blogs.

Here's my favorite bit:

"The idea that somehow physical engineering is difficult and expensive and unpopular, while changing human behaviour is quick, easy, cheap and effective, is one that the British are remarkably strongly attached to."

This is brilliant because it's obvious that if people are willing to change the way that they live their lives, they would totally be willing to spare no time nor money at all for proper cycling infrastructure.

Thus, it's clear to prove that those who are opposed to infrastructure are not going to be good citizens on the roads. Ever. 

On the contrary, those who are willing to wait for cyclists, to not buzz us, and so on, invariably tend to support protecting us through government money.

Plus, this comment struck me as spot on:

"Certainly ‘vehicular cycling’ amd ‘educating motorists’ (sans real legal penalties, vigorously enforced) simply don’t work at all as a solution, because they are rather obviously fatally flawed in theory and falsified in practice. Its a bad-faith alternative suggested by those who don’t want to admit they don’t want to do anything at all."

Good job, <a href="http://waronthemotorist.wordpress.com">WOTM</a>.

  <title>Motoring Infrastructure: Long Standing Money Pit</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/08/28/motoring-infrastructure-long-standing-money-pit/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Until very, very recently, there was little to no accountability for motoring infrastructure.

This story made my day:

http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/08/710-freeway-extension-killed-assemblyman.html

There has been an assumption that motoring infrastructure was "necessary to drive economic development".

Time and time again, however, we find that they wind up hollowing out our cities, creating ghettos.

Still, the logic is that if freeways were so bad for regions, why were they building them.

From the article:

"“Representatives of the California Department of Transportation and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority have routinely misrepresented important information while hiding the true cost and benefit of this project from the public,” he added."

But why is this on a bike blog?

Because as a pro-infrastructurist, I have been grappling with the whole "gas money" argument for quite a while.

LTR's know that my usual approach, instead of being defensive, "please give me some of your gas money", I prefer to go to the other side and burn their house down.

Here we go again.

The standard for things like public transportation, for example, is for it to pay for itself. This is, in part, because it's easier to charge people to get on a train than it is to drive their car. It would be impractical to put polling stations on every block and not worth it.

So we use the whole "gas money" which does not pay for all roads, and today it does not even pay for the maintenance for the federal highway system.

Why do we not hear more about motorists paying their way?

Because, of course, it's politically unpopular to question motoring in any way.

As I said above, motoring is seen as an economic benefit showering their largess on the little people on the bus and in the bike lanes until they feel exploited no more and they yell out of the window of a building. Or until they cut the federal funding.

In the past, I have made the argument that money for bike paths and lanes is actually just more money for motorists because it mitigates to a degree a danger that the government created by building dangerous roads. Also, bike lanes and paths are used by motorists more often than by cyclists, only, for parking in, storing heavy equipment, dog walking and so on.

True cycling infrastructure will have all other uses prohibited and the vast majority of its users will ride their bikes there from their houses. We don't really have any of this in San Diego so we have about zero percent of the "gas money" going to cycling.

This leads back to the main question which is WHY IS THE MOTORING TRANSPORTATION SUCH A FAILURE? It seems to require more money each year, it does not make back it's "investments". And despite having the lion's share of the transportation budget, I still hear constant whining from motorists. It's practically a way to make friends by mentioning how awful the traffic is or the parking situation is.

Of course, nobody wants to hear the cyclists complain. They'd just tell him to get a car.

But overall, despite spending almost no money on cycling, I really can't complain too much. Or rather, I don't. Perhaps I have been conditioned to keep mum because nobody cares?

At any rate, I still wonder how we are going to extract all the money on motoring infrastructure back from motorists? When will they completely mitigate the dangers, smog, and noise of motoring? If they do mitigate it, will they see this as some kind of "war on motoring" or as motorists, finally taking "personal responsibility" for the cost that they subject society to? How many dollars need to be spent before "traffic sucked" or "parking is tight" ceases to be a conversation starter? One trillion more? Two trillion?

I think that our elected officials need to be asked these questions.

While it's only fair for us to crawl through glass for each and every bike lane and train line, shouldn't each road widening get the same treatment?]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I just read a great <a href="http://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2012/08/-malicous-compliance.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+typepad%2FBobsutton%2Fmy_weblog+%28Bob+Sutton%29">blog post</a> which talks about malicious compliance.

This is where one follows the rules, perfectly, to the letter in a way which makes things hell for someone.

To me, it's a particularly nasty kind of "passive aggression".

I have seen this often in cycling advocacy when people continually bring up obscure parts of the highway design code in order to shoot down safe and efficient designs for cycling infrastructure.

Whenever you see someone argue against some really good infrastructure and they say something like, "it's against the law" or "liability", they are probably engaging in a form of malicious compliance.

This can also be seen when there are bike lanes which are inconsistent in width, but super narrow. This is because they were measured from the curb which is not totally straight and riding in them would have one ride mostly in the gutter.

When I see cycling infrastructure, I know immediately if the makers would ever ride on their handy-work. Often the answer is, "no."

The answer is not resignation and saying "no" to everything, but rather saying, "yes", then making it better.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The comment that inspired this <a href="https://departmentfortransport.wordpress.com/2012/08/19/franklin-and-forester-quotes-in-a-dutch-context/">blog post (comment by Frank).</a>

"There are many people here in the U.S. who argue against crude copies of Dutch infrastructure because they’ve seen firsthand the problems with the crude copies – and because they know accurate copies will never be politically or economically possible."

We covered this before, this is a depressive line of thinking called "fortune telling." We don't know what is and is not politically possible unless we try to make it so. Though most citizens want cycling infrastructure, it's the politicians who have decided against it.

There are many reasons for it, but I think that the number one reason is that vehicular (meaning cars for VC nuts NOT bicycles) has been prioritized in the US for almost a century now.

Why?

In part because those making decisions all drive cars. So they are building stuff for themselves.

But when this is considered to be impossible, we also have a self-fulfilling prophasy.

Nobody asks for infrastructure because they don't like being laughed at or ignored. Try it, you'll see.

Here's a cool transition from the same comment:

"Some posting here don’t see those problems; they are thoroughly convinced that Dutch design – or a crude approximation – is the answer everywhere."

This is a strange statement because it says answer but not the question. I guess the question is how to make cycling safer, more efficient, and comfortable (SEC). 

Dutch style infrastructure does accomplish all those goals.

I think that Frank has realized this. This he goes to the next fall back position. When he argues with a new set of people, I suspect, he'll forget this and reset to saying that Dutch infrastructure is dangerous. We'll see if this is true.

But here's Frank's next question:

"Those people might try producing a list of the other countries that have adopted the same designs over as large a percentage of their roadways as have the Dutch. Then they might list the political processes that made such a change possible."

Note, how he's asking for something which another tactic that VCers always do, to demand something that they can evaluate, judge, then reject. If you comply, you'll be running around, like a monkey, forever.

The first question is irrelevant. It's of a similar type I have see by those who are trying to confuse people which assumes that once the best solution is available, it will soon be available everywhere. This is highly untrue in many cases.

Good solutions to problems don't become magically available as they often disrupt "business as usual." Often there are stakeholders in keeping things sucky because they stand to gain in either employment or business.

But in this case, I will answer the second question.

1. Stop saying that VC is good for the time and place and start saying it sucks.

2. Shut Forrester, Franklin, and the newer sleeker clones out of politics completely. Totally discredit them and their ideas. Don't form alliances, don't compromise. Get them to retire and to move on. Shout down any opposition.

3. Get people elected who truly believe in cycling. Take them to trips to places where cycling really shines and let them see for themselves. When they come back, get them to pledge at least ten percent of the budget for cycling. Have them appoint people in all aspects of transportation departments and back them up.

4. Fight back against motoring interests. We need to speak more often and louder at every single meeting. We need to control the message. We need to make it clear that cycling is fun, safe, normal, healthy, and cool. This is probably the hardest thing to do because in Hollywood, for example, cycling is short hand for a crazy loser.

5. Hold motorists 100% accountable for paying for the mitigation costs of their activities. You should be able to stand, in most parts of the city, especially the parks, and hold a conversion without hearing vehicle noises all the time. You should be able to jaywalk or commit other kinds of mild mistakes without getting the death penalty. 

6. Ban motoring in areas where it doesn't make sense.

7. Form alliances with pedestrian and transit advocates and GET ON THE SAME PAGE. Stop getting tricked into fighting for pennies.

Finally, in another comment, Frank posts that "we are short on money." If he took two seconds to google how much in the US is spent each year by the Federal government on motoring, he'd realize that we're really, really, really flush with money.

Another few minutes, and he'd see posts of several differing design plans and it turns out the cycling infrastructure is always far less expensive than motoring infrastructure.

So we aren't taking "scarce resources from motoring" but rather they are choosing to put cyclists and others at risk because they are taking money that should be used for mitigation efforts.

  <title>Forester Had No Impact on Cycling in the US (NOT!!)</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I don't know why we get this comment, but I guess the notion is to discredit those who like infrastructure as "conspiracy theorists" rather than arguing their case?

http://www.johnforester.com/Articles/Social/My%20History.htm

I just took the quotes where he actively did things. I did not check to see the result.

One can read the entire page for details.

1. Product Design Laws for Bicycles

"One result was the Consumer Product Safety Commission of the United States, empowered to issue safety regulations that had the force of law for most consumer products...I held the CPSC to the law, first with comments on the proposed versions of the regulation, then by suing the CPSC itself...The motorists got the point; BMA didn't get a single vote in favor, as I remember."

2. Bikeway design standards:

"After one particularly harrowing presentation by a salesman for bollards to mark bicycle lanes, I bought a Gestetner Mimeograph and started issuing reports to all the cyclists I knew in California. That stirred the California cycling world into writing letters to the committee expressing opposition to its work."

"As a result of the efforts of cyclists against this discrimination, we were able to head off the intended mandatory-bike-path law by demonstrating how dangerous side-path cycling was. However, were unable to head off the mandatory-bike-lane law, and we were unable to get repeal of the mandatory-side-of-the-road law. Whenever I pointed out how that law, as originally written years before, contradicted standard traffic law, the committee members protected the discriminatory law by inserting exceptions, and they did the same thing with the mandatory-bike-lane law. Many cyclists nowadays think that those exceptions were inserted into the law through the goodness of heart of the committee members, but that is entirely incorrect. The committee members inserted exceptions only to protect the discriminatory law from judges who thought cyclists should obey the normal traffic laws rather than the imperfect and discriminatory law written for cyclists alone. "

"The resistance by cyclists against discrimination, and their demonstration of the dangers of the UCLA bikeway standards to lawful, competent cyclists, prevented those standards from being adopted. California therefore set up a new committee, the California Statewide Bicycle Facilities Committee, to design new standards. Of the eight members, cyclists were allowed two; the rest represented branches of government."

"My leadership of the cyclists' resistance had made me unacceptable on the new committee, but, since I was by then president of the California Association of Bicycling Organizations, they could not keep me from attending and submitting papers. In my attempts to redirect the committee to making cycling safer rather than discriminating against cyclists, I wrote probably about half of the paperwork produced by the committee. My close associate, Professor John Finley Scott, of the sociology department of UC Davis, represented CABO, and Richard Blunden, a state government employee, acted as representative of the League of American Wheelmen. "

"The result of all this was that the Federal government and the states adopted the California bikeway standards, presumably because these had gone through the fire of cyclists' criticism and were least likely to produce liability judgements against the governments' agencies."

Thus, he claims to have influenced standards that make up Federal Standards. If anything, he's been under-estimated in his impact, not over-estimated.

3. Effective Cycling Book.

This book is widely available. Some cycling organizations recommenced it and even handed out copies. Inside you'll find the tactics that are still used to this very day on how to stop cycling infrastructure including attending meetings, threatening liability problems, nit picking, and more. Please borrow a copy, don't buy a new one, and check it out.

4. Cycling Safety Courses. 

I have not taken a class, but I have heard that many of the instructors use this supposedly neutral class to impart their political views into their students.

This is why when a new advocate is disagreeable, they urge her to "take a class". This phony paperwork is used as some kind of traffic engineering certification for judging the safety of bikeway design. 

VC advocates urge this kind of deception.

There are course in roadway engineering, but they are much more rigorous. Their opinions on bikeways are much more informed and nuanced.

Thus, there are many new students still indoctrinated each year in these notions.

These people do post comments and attend meetings. 

There's much more, but this is a start.

Thus, I never want to hear again, that "Forester had NO IMPACT ON INFRASTRUCTURE in the US" as this is a lie.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Toward Vs. Away Thinking</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/08/31/toward-vs-away-thinking/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[LTRs know that I have been studying human motivation for a while.

At a basic level there are only two kinds of motivation which explain all behavior. These motivations are so basic that even single celled organisms follow them: away vs. toward.

That is, some people do things because they expect some kind of reward while others do them in order to avoid pain.

In general, VC shows away thinking, and infrastructure promotion is toward.

This is very evident in the language which either side uses: "They are going to take AWAY our rights to the road."

Vs.

"We can build a better world for everyone no matter how they get around."

The VC objection to any infrastructure is that it might be worse.

Normal people engage in both styles, though usually individuals will let one form dominate their lives.

Problems occur when people try to communicate with a differing style. That will almost never work.

So it's a complete waste of time to extoll the benefits of new infrastructure because the more you talk aobut change, the more people are going to fear losing what they all ready have: "If we have infrastructure then we'll lose our rights to the road." And, "Careful what you wish for." 

See the fear behind these messages?

Thus, there is opposition to the mandatory side path provision instead of arguing for making the side path awesome.

So are we stuck?

Not at all.

Both sides can agree on one thing, "if we don't grow, we die." In other words, "if our rights don't expand, they will be taken away."

Thus, I would argue that if we don't continue to expand the importance of cycling as transportation, we'll, instead, be constantly fighting, and 
<a href="http://www.johnforester.com/League%20Reform.htm">losing, rear guard actions, forever.</a>

If we talk about how not to lose with those VC people on the fence then perhaps they can be convinced.

SARCASM ON
It's tough, though, as my side of the debate is stuck with such phrases such as "We are winning, just not fast enough."
SARCASM OFF

For me, the take home message, is that I don't want to tell people how to ride their bicycles, what to wear, nor what to wish for.

I do, however, want people to know that I highly enjoy being on the winning side.

I am not a bicycle advocate, but I do approve and support their activities in all ways.

Thus, when I am seventy, I hope to have a web page similar to above, but instead of talking about all the things that I have lost for cycling, instead, I will be praising the advocates for what they have gained.

Go, infrastructure!]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Bike Hate and Individual Advocacy: Solved!</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/09/05/bike-hate-and-individual-advocacy-solved/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[At one time, I did engage in individual advocacy which was trying to convince people to live their lives in better ways. 

I naively figured that if I could meet their objections with facts, I could convince people of anything.

The joke was on me.

There were many things I did not know about how people make decisions. I still feel that I am scratching the surface.

However, here's one thing I learned today, the more someone hates an activity, the more someone will feel that it's dangerous and not beneficial to society.

I learned this from the the excellent: _Thinking Fast and Slow_.

Although, I had long suspected this fact, now it's confirmed. I wrote earlier about how people would come to me with horror stories about how someone they knew was hurt by cycling. Usually the person in the story was an idiot, but since they were family members or something, it would be polite to point this out.

Thus, I'd suffer through story after story of death.

Now I realize that this is just their soft way of telling me that they don't like cycling. Which is a silly thing to do because I really don't care what they think about my cycling.

This is because I don't believe in individual advocacy. This does not work.

What am I going to do, talk to each and every person? That would take forever!

Ironically, people accuse me of trying to get them to bicycle all the time.

Last night, I met a guy hiking who accused me of this.

He said, "you are trying to get me to ride a bike."

I said, literally, not a paraphrase:

1. I don't engage in individual advocacy.

2. I'm not an advocate at all, though I support their efforts.

Then he said, "But HOW can I ride a bike?"

I told him NOT to ride a bike because it was too dangerous and impractical in San Diego.

He continued his rant on how cycling was too hard due to our hills.

I pointed out, twice, that we had this problem licked in the 1800's due to advancements in construction and explosives technology. 

I pointed out that the freeway that he drove on was a very low grade. I asked him if he had noticed.

He blathered about hills around his house.

I dropped the topic after that.

This morning, when I read a section of _Thinking Fast and Slow_, it clicked.

He didn't want to be convinced to ride a bike like he claimed.

He wanted to be able to put up sufficient excuses that is to meet my facts with enough objections so he felt "justified" in driving his car because otherwise, he would feel guilty.

I'm not a priest. If you feel guilty driving a car, don't do it.

Or do it and be guilty.

I don't care what you do.

I love everyone in the world.]]></content:encoded>

Thus, government intervention, in building a road, made walking really difficult, inconvenient, and dangerous.

Again, I suggest either going all the way and making walking good again, or defuding the roads and letting the whole thing go back to hiking and mountain biking trails.

Current levels of spending just make walking (and cycling for most of us) suck.]]></wp:comment_content>

I contradict myself as part of my own personal practice is to accept that fact that I am not important, in the grand scheme of things, and that my feelings don't matter.

But for this post, let's consider them for a moment.

Do my feelings on noise matter at all to anyone but me? Does anyone go out of their way to drive a quiet vehicle for me?

No.

Does anyone care that they are endangering me each time they pass me?

No.

Does anyone really care that they are polluting the air I breath?

No.

Do businesses post bicycle directions for me online? Do they have bike parking for me in most venues? When inviting me to venues do people consider the range of a bicycle?

No. No. No.

So why do I have to care if you have to wait a few minutes for the critical mass bikes to clear an intersection?

Why do I have to care that you felt "unsafe" from some bicycles. Bicycles!

In Hollywood movies,we are losers and freaks.

Until that changes people have NO RIGHT to call us scary, too. You can't have it both ways. 

I want it known that I DO care about motorists and their feelings.

I do consider myself to be a motorist on occasion so I have all your fears and ambitions, your loves and hates.

I get MORE annoyed by bad behaving cyclists than most motorists.

But I do consider it to be the height of hypocrisy to get pissy about CM which is totally out of proportionate to the minor inconvenience it causes. Also, this completely ignores the overall positive message and experience that it provides.

So please, if you are going to spend five minutes bending my ear to trash critical mass let me respond in kind to tell how obnoxious motorists have ruined my day and almost killed me. 

Lots and lots and lots of times.

Thanks for listening.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Yes, Joe, I think you make an excellent point.

CM is the ink blot test of cycling: a protest, a rolling party, a riot, a peaceful ride, and a bike race.

How you see CM is a reflection on how you see cycling. Those who hate bikes hate CM. Those who love bikes love CM. Those who ride, sometimes, can either love or hate it depending upon how much uncertainty they are willing to live with.]]></wp:comment_content>

What is the kernel of truth in people's disdain for Critical Mass beyond it's challenging of the status quo?

  <title>Three Strikes Law: Vehicular Style </title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/09/06/three-strikes-law-vehicular-style/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Often where there's a news story in the main stream media, we see a slew of comments from cycling haters about how cyclists "never stop for stop signs" and all kinds of other garbage. 

I have been working on this case for a while, and I do believe in following the law which is why I tell people that I do tend to follow the law. I make mistakes, like all humans, but my heart is in the direction of the law which is why I have no problems with the Three Strikes Law.

Not the original one which I find to be highly unfair.

Rather, I made up a new one as a response to "all cyclists run stop signs and the cops do nothing. We oughta license cyclists." And "blah blah, cyclists are criminals, blah blah."

Here we go with the law. Note, I'm not a lawyer, blah blah. This is NOT the text of a well written law. Buyer beware and so on.

1. After any three minor traffic violations, in a vehicle, you lose your license for a year. No questions asked. No stoppy, no drivey. 

2. Second three violations or if you drive without a license, you lose your license for ten years.

3. Subsequent set of three violations means you lose your license for life. Do not pass go, do not drive ever again.

Chorus: But what about cyclists, they don't need a license.

4. A bicycle is a vehicle. You run three stop lights on a bike (or trike) you lose your license.

5. Cyclists who would like to ride "vehicularly" as spelled out by _Effective Cycling_ need a valid driver's license.

6. Children (and adults) who ride to the side of the road either on the sidewalk or door zone need no license as they aren't acting as "vehicles" but rather they are treated like pedestrians.

7. Due to the excessive tax burden a duplicate government entity to create a whole new license for bicycles, the normal DMV will allow the car driver's license to apply to cycling. We are in tough economic times and all that. However, now that the driver's license doubles as a bicycle license, all motorists will have to demonstrate, in a real world test, bicycle competency in addition to motoring competency. Otherwise, we can't be sure that we license those who truly know the bicycle "rules of the road."

Chorus: But we can't afford to enforce all this.

8. The government will create a mobile phone app which will allow citizen reporting of traffic violations by making recordings and sending them in. These recordings will trigger an automatic traffic ticket and or removal of driver's license.

9. Due to the effectiveness of "citizen reporting" (see #8) we will cut the traffic police budget by 75%. The excess money will go to the tax payers as a direct tax refund in year one. In subsequent years it will either be a tax cut or the excess money will go to pay down the budget of the general fund.

The advantages of this plan are strict enforcement of traffic laws, tax breaks, balancing budgets, smaller government, answering ALL motorist objections to cyclists, safer streets, reduced accidents, and lower gas prices.

EVERYONE wins except for criminal cyclists and nobody likes them anyway,]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Yoga and Cycling: Two Great Tastes!</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I have never taken a yoga class.

That didn't stop HR, for a year after I was hired, from introducing me to each and every person as someone who does yoga.

This didn't bother me because I'd much, much like being called the yoga guy rather than the bike guy. This is not unlike a dad who has his baseball mitt in his car and is called the "baseball guy" instead of Dale Earnhardt Jr. :)

Also, I do walk around with a pink yoga mat, but this is for meditation, and many people don't know the difference.

LTRs know that I often meditate and bicycle. 

Now, there's a <a href="http://takingthelane.com/zine/#ecwid:category=1726506&amp;mode=product&amp;product=11970920">book</a> and a <a href="http://yogaforbikers.me/">blog</a> on yoga!

I am so getting this book because finally, I'll have a yoga routine that I have time for.

I originally, learned about yoga and cycling from a friend who taught me some basic stretches that allowed her to ride for miles without getting sore or tight. I do some of them all the time especially standing up, while going downhill, to stretch my hamstrings.

I have not read this book, yet, but I am so going to get a copy--I have not been this excited about a book for a long time.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'll write more about this, but it seems that people either plan too much for unlikely events or too little.

The probability of an event has little to do with how much they panic.

For my last fall, neither karate nor a helmet would have done much good. I fell too fast; I was on the ground before I knew it. My helmet was in pieces, though. My head was fine. My helmet didn't "save" me by falling apart, it was on my handle bars! :)

I consider the constant obsession with bicycle crashes to be really depressing and unnecessary. 

I do apprecaite Ted Rogers because he's the news for So. Cal, but man, bad accidents in cycling are rare especially when we are separated from cars (which do crash quite often).]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well, I won't judge. On the other hand, your many falls make falling less likely statistically.

Black ice is the worst, and totally unavoidable.

I would NEVER suggest that people put themselves at more risk.

I am just against compulsory helmet laws.

Furthermore, I wonder if better infrastructure would help.

In CPH, they plow their bike lanes FIRST and thus black ice would have been much less of a problem.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Executive Summary: Sprawl sucks because it's a form of boring and lazy development which sucks the life of an otherwise beautiful landscape. Since sprawl makes cycling so much more dangerous and difficult, we should address it here.

Longer Article:

I thought that I would only have a single blog post on this topic, but now I realize that it is a huge, huge topic in which the causes have spread from the city center all the way out deep into the former country side.

Why tackle sprawl on a biking blog?

One of the biggest reasons that people don't ride a bicycle is that they don't think that it's practical.

When offered showers, and extra time to get to work, and protected bicycle infrastructure, they will say that it's "too far."

For many of them, they are being misleading. Many people have little personal worth outside of their ownership of an automobile. They fear the opinions of their friends and co-workers if they were seen outside on a bicycle rather than inside a car.

However, for many people, the real reason is the distances. These are caused by sprawl.

I know that for me, sprawl makes my environment suck even when I am not cycling. There is no place outside my work building where I have a seconds rest from the constant auto noises. Walking kind of sucks because I feel like a second class citizen and the landscape is monotonous. There are few places to within walking distance because each business is surrounded by a huge sea of concrete.

I have had reports of people in my dance class who say that it is highly practical for them to ride a bike to work but they are too afraid of getting hit by a car. A cycle track along the road will make it feel safer, but again, the noises and the feel of constant cars whizzing by is unpleasant to all but the most hard core VCer who gets some kind of erotic thrill from getting constantly buzzed which makes them feel safer each time a giant piece of metal nearly turns them into chutney. :)

Next sprawl post, I'll continue on solving the bicycle killing mystery that is sprawl.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>I Heart Huckaby</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Apparently, in Portland, there's going to be a 
<a href="http://streetsblog.net/2012/09/06/one-mans-push-to-require-bike-licenses-in-oregon/">ballot initiative</a> which will create a bicycle license for those without one.

While I semi-humorously talked about being in favor of licenses, I am hoping that this guy succeeds. I feel that state sanctioning of my mode is the way to go. 

Note, this is totally serious.

Not that I'd waste a second of my time on this campaign that's clearly done with bad intentions.

However, I feel that this will totally backfire in Mr. Huckaby's (and the other hater's) faces.

Here are some reasons:

1. If I have a bicycle license, I no longer need a driver's license which means that I can let my lousy motoring skills further wither. Plus in my crowd, cycling is seen as a sign of extreme wealth (elitism), extreme health (I don't know how you have the strength to bike to work each day), and it's cool.

2. The more the state talks about cycling the better. THE MORE THE STATE TALKS ABOUT CYCLING THE BETTER. I mean, we're going to have our own branch of the DMV! This means that they are going to have to start teaching police officers the real laws on cycling.

3. If I have a license from the state, I have more clout in demanding bicycle access to employment as well as parking. Plus, I have a picture ID, state granted right to the road. Now when people yell, get off the road, I can flash my cool Bicycle ID, and they will know that I am a STATE SANCTIONED CYCLIST. Not some dirty commie who is stealing from the system and riding through the cracks.

4. Now one of the biggest threats and complaints that ugly motorists have against cyclists is now gone. GONE! Especially if we have cute little license plates. When people post shit about ALL of us not following traffic laws, we can say, "did you get the plate number?" As if the cops actually care about plate numbers (hint: unless there's a rich or important person hurt they don't). The more political ammo we can take about from motorists the weaker they get. 

5. If there are large crackdowns on motoring violations, motorists will pay the lion's share of it. You can't have it both ways. You can't continue to roll stop signs, buzz cyclists, and bitch about red light cameras while at the same time whining that the state needs to "do something" about "scofflaw cyclists."

Further more, I have noticed that this is one of the things that I call a Tea Bag Exception (TBE). That is the government sucks at everything and spending any more is a total waste of time UNLESS IT AFFECTS ME! Then the sky's the limit on government spending and I'll remain strangely silent about how bad the government sucks.

6. Finally, cyclist outrage is what this guy wants. He thinks that a license will make cycling go away forever. I strongly disagree. I feel that a license will get all cyclists more connected with the government in ways that motorists are all ready connected. 

For Huckaby, this can only be a Very Bad ThingTM.

So I urge all Portlanders to vote a resounding YES on being recognized and approved by the government. Only follow up with the notice that everywhere that laws are strictly enforced for cyclists must have matching government spending in making sure that cycling is safe, comfortable, and efficient for all levels of official government license holders.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Taboo Tradeoffs</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/09/10/taboo-tradeoffs/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[A taboo trade off is the irrational idea that we must hold safety as 100% sacred and we must not make any trade offs. Ever.

This is an irrational idea because we have limited budgets, but this taboo means that we'll spend an infinite amount of money for the illusion of safety. 

I say illusion because to maximize safety with a real world budget would mean that we would divide the number of lives lost per dollars spent. Plus, we would seek out and ban the most dangerous activities such as showering and walking (for head injuries).

In this nightmarish world, we'd also ban motoring. 

Since we live in the "real world" where people are way more irrational than my imaginary world, we waste a ton of money on things that we think are safe.

This means sticking to conventional activities and eschewing the "strange" EVEN IF THE STRANGE IS SAFER!

This is the heart of this irrationality.

This is why cycling is seen as "insane" even though it is highly inherently safe, some might say safer than actually walking!

So how dangerous is cycling?

The census shows a rough <a href="http://www.governing.com/blogs/by-the-numbers/bicycle-commuter-data-for-american-cities.html">730,000 cyclists in the US.</a>

Of this number, there are <a href="http://www.bicyclinginfo.org/facts/crash-facts.cfm">618 fatalities nation wide.</a> This gives us a death rate of roughly 0.08% per year. Pretty tiny. 

With such a tiny risk, do people feel that cycling is safe?

No. One of the major, major objections to cycling commuting is that it's extremely dangerous which means that cyclists are 100% responsible for their deaths.

This is a silly idea because as I said, cycling, alone is extremely safe and when mixed with extremely dangerous autos, it's still pretty safe.

But how safe is motoring?

There are <a href="http://www. slideshare.net/marcus.bowman.slides/us-commuting-statistical-analysis">97 million motoring commuters in the US.</a> This lead to <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/driveon/post/2012/05/2011-may-have-had-fewest-traffic-fatalities-ever/1#.UE61Ejt3Cgs">about 32,000 motorists killing themselves and each other per year.</a>

Thus, motoring death rate is 0.03% which is almost THREE TIMES SAFER THAN CYCLING.

On the other hand, the death rate for cycling is very, very close to zero. A small change in any number close to zero is likely to be a very large percent change. This is one of the laws of small numbers.

Still, motoring is much safer which is why it's a taboo to cycle--among other reasons.

This also means that the government should spend triple the money to make cycling safer when in fact, is spends almost no money at all.

Overall, despite the taboo, cycling is a total bargain for cyclists and motorists alike. This fact ought to be celebrated which is what I'm doing right now.

Join the party or go home. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>The People that You Meet</title>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[In his excellent book, Bike Snob (http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com) has classified the types of cyclists in New York. I'd like to do the same in San Diego, sometime.

For now, I am starting to classify the types of people whom I have spoken to about the exciting possibilities for cycling in San Diego.

The biggest take home finding is that people have very well thought out and very strong misconceptions about cycling.

There's just so much misinformation out there regarding the laws, the effects of infrastructure on mode share, safety issues and so much more junk.

As I have been spending five minutes a day on googling information as well as speaking to, daily, one of the greatest cycling minds ever, I have started to accumulate a coherent vision of cycling. This is nowhere near as brilliant as Amsterdam or Copenhagen (http://www.copenhagenize.com), but it's a start.

Thus, my new goal is get a series of questions to see how people break down into categories of misconceptions.

1. They get it. This is easy. They read _Traffic_ they are trying to get rid of their car, and their friends and family think that they are totally insane. They spent a few weeks frothing at the mouth and now they are calming down and looking for people who also get it. No work at all to spot.

However, my big, big mistake is to think that if someone speaks about bikes, they are this person. They might not be.

2. Sporty and they don't get it. They may or may not ride a bike, but they definitely believe BAT (bicycles are toys). There are two types of these, real roadies who think that the streets are 100% fine for cycling. These people feel that if you aren't fit and strong you don't deserve to ride.

The second sporty type will only ride bicycles on the board walk or go on group rides. 

Both groups predominately generate even more congestion and motor vehicle miles because they need to drive around with their bikes on a rack.

They totally don't get infrastructure at all unless it goes nowhere. These people's views on cycling are the reason that when any money at all is spent on cycling, it goes to places that are really out of the way.

They think that cyclovia should be on Harbor Island.

Don't talk about infrastructure. Get them talking about their bicycle, how their cousin broke some records back in '83, and their childhood.

3. Hate bikes. These people will never say that. They do say, "streets are for cars." "You need a car in So. Cal." "Cycling is not practical." 

Then they will tell you a story how a relative got hit by a car and they aren't the same again.

Their primary interest in bikes is total control of each cyclist. They prefer to see cyclists who are helmeted, obey traffic laws, and dead.

They oppose infrastructure (costs too much) and riding on the road (dangerous and gets in the way).

Avoid this type because they are heartless assholes.

4. Sort of get it but not really. This type is too scared to bicycle. They too are obsessed with helmets. They are often mountain bikers. They sometimes do group rides.
They love bikes in an abstract way especially for their environmental aspects. They often worship actual cycle commuters, but see their situation as much different which is why they don't bike right now.

They constantly wistfully talk about how they wish that they could ride a bike, but it's too hard in San Diego. They too see no notion of any kind of change. In fact, that's the number one commonality among all types: they do not see a better nor a different future from the time when gas costs a dollar a gallon, I mean two dollars, oops, that is, gas will not cost more than four or five dollars a gallon ever because all change is impossible.

They will probably not ride a bicycle even if we built a cycle track with their name on it from their house to their job.

You should probe for their real objections. After each one say, "If we could meet that objection, could I count on you riding your bicycle everyday to work?" You will probably be able to say this phrase about ten times because the objections keep coming like clowns out of a Geo Metro.

There are probably many more types, but this is a good start. 

Next step is to get some specific questions and memorize them regarding exactly what kind of person they are.

Perhaps we could get some new categories as well.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Study: Impact of Infrastructure on Cycling</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[While my main motivation for my desire for infrastructure is SEC: safety, efficiency, and comfort for me, I do believe that we should, a least a little bit, show come concern for others:

In the following <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCMQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fsunnyvale.ca.gov%2FPortals%2F0%2FSunnyvale%2FDPW%2FBPAC%2FBPAC%2520July%252019-2012%2520Agenda_Part2%2520web.pdf&amp;ei=4KFYUOKMBKetigKR_YDADg&amp;usg=AFQjCNETnC3UYqkFUACATB_eDuujpHRQKw&amp;sig2=bpMYLi5FImsUrasACe-Gew">study,</a> infrastructure is compared with many differing variables:



Here are some of the findings.

Despite the "poor" stereotype and the contradictory, but equally spouted, "elite" nonsense, there's actually no statistically significant correlation between household income and bicycle riding to work.

A 10% greater supply of bike lanes is associated with a 3.1% greater number of cycling commuters. Similar, benefits, a 2.5% increase in commuters is associated with a similar increase in bicycle paths.

A 10% higher share of cyclist fatalities is associated with a 3.7% drop in commuters.

On the other hand, the weather is not strongly coorelated with cycling rates.

Overall, this was a fantastic paper that analyzed a great deal of data. I suggest reading the entire thing from cover to cover.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Lately, I feel that there has been too much anger and divisiveness. This is probably only in my mind, but it's something that I have been feeling.

Perhaps some of it stems from the <a href="http://commuteorlando.com/wordpress/2011/07/07/i-am-not-a-bicyclist/">misuse of a Dalai Lama quote</a> to advocate against safety improvements for cyclists.

Seriously, I'm not making this up.

"Geez. I could’ve saved myself a lot of work and just quoted the Dalai Lama.

'When you think everything is someone else’s fault, you will suffer a lot. When you realize that everything springs only from yourself, you will learn both peace and joy.'"

I really wanted to respond to this, but I have held myself back for many reasons, but overall, I would like to see more peace and joy and less nonsense.

Or it could have been increased verbal attacks on cyclists by motorists who would like cycling to be made as dangerous as possible by the state then to argue that we all have a "choice" to cycle. Ug.

Or even the retarded notion that I am supposed to say "freedom" instead of "choice" because the anti-abortion but pro-cycling people will be offended. Double Ug.

So I continue my attempt to get all <a href="http://deerparkmonastery.org/mindfulness-practice/the-fourteen-mindfulness-trainings">Fourteen Mindfulness Verses </a>and relate them to cycling.

The Fourth Mindfulness Training: Awareness of Suffering

This one is really hard for me because I think that suffering really sucks, and it's hard for me to "come home to it" as this verse asks.

My usual pain since having a dream SO, dream job, and living in my dream location has been boredom. This is kind of lame, but most of my life's suffering has been really lame--I never really suffered. This actually makes things worse because it makes me feel guilty for feeling bad about nothing.

This boredom and success lead to my mid-life crisis (MLC). I think tha this is because I had spent my whole life fighting the world, and once things became perfect, it was too much to bear. I had to create some problems for myself.

The worst time I had was when I had to stop meditating as a form of refuge--or escape from suffering. This was due to the mania of having too much joy and bliss. I knew that I was set to fall, but I chose to continue anyway.

Other mediators told me to cultivate equanimity, but I failed at this despite my (feeble) attempts.

Thus my main refuge now is television, alcohol and physical pleasure (hello surfing and cycling). On the other hand, I know that meditation has to be a part of my life.

On the plus side, my princess has read my mind, and freed me from pain, mainly by listening deeply to me and by being there for me as a stable rock that I know will be there for me.

Cycling is the kind of thing that I do so much that I don't think much of it, but when I think about not having it in my life, that is a sort of suffering.

All the other stuff has been self-created, and I fixed most of it with time and _Feeling Good_.

I have come to the conclusion that the main meditation that I'm going to work on for the next year is Loving Kindness, which I blogged about earlier. This is helping a great deal. Also, what helps is working on my novel which is really total self-indulgence.

At this point, my main source of sorrow and rage is the anti-cycling nonsense which I probably should not read, but I seem to have some kind of fatal attraction to that.

Fortunately (or perhaps the opposite) everyone currently left in my life is very pro-cycling.

Anyway, this was fun but difficult to write about.

This is a huge topic, so there will be much more, hopefully stuff that's less personal and more useful to the general readers.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Sharrows Are Tombstones</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Literalists beware!

This means you.

I don't mean that sharrows are literally tombstones, but rather they are markers for where good infrastructure died.

What are sharrows? They are shared lane markings in the style of a Chevron (yes like the gas station).

These are painted willy nilly in the center of the road sometimes and other times in the parking lane depending upon whether cars were parked that day. No joke here.

Wikipedia mainly has reviews of sharrows which is really biased. 

Shame wikipedia! Shame.

Overall, I think that sharrows suck, wikipedia be damned.

Which is why I really get mad when I read articles <a href="http://www.coronadelmartoday.com/31099/home/bike-safety-improvements-discussed-at-residents-meeting/">like this!</a> (Thanks BikingInLA).

First of all, sharrows are the whole "take the lane" nonsense in paint. I have previously proven how this is extremely rude and dangerous and it makes cyclists look like arrogant douches. Don't take the lane. Please don't.

Some sharrows are painted green. I don't care if they are painted red or blue or purple because they DON'T WORK.

By work, I mean make cyclists in a statistically and real way safer. For example, in Long Beach, after sharrows are pained accidents went up: http://www.westernite.org/annualmeetings/santabarb12/Compendium/7B-Nagananda-Parentela.doc.

Also, non-brainwashed cyclists don't really use them and they don't like them:

"About 40% of the respondents strongly felt Class III bicycle lanes are more prone to collision, while about 35% felt Class II bicycle lanes are more prone to collision.  About 5% each felt that green lane with sharrows and Class I bicycle lanes were prone to collisions, and about 15% did not have an answer.  These results are also consistent with the accident data."

The way that sharrows are supposed to work is to get people to ride in a "correct" manner which is VC superstition that they think that if they "follow the rules" they will be safe. They are not.

The reason they believe this is because of the power of small numbers. That is, there are so few people riding VC that the chance that any of them dies in an accident is very low. This proves nothing except for a basic lack of statistical knowledge.

When I rode the green sharrows in Long Beach, I felt in danger and continually buzzed. Contrast this to how safe, efficient and comfort my ride felt in Long Beach's cycle tracks.

Motorists have no idea what sharrows are. When they are told that this means that I can "take the lane" they say things like, "but I knew you could do that all ready, what am I stupid? Do I need a reminder?" OR "That's stupid riding in the road, it should be illegal."

Nobody said, "I didn't know that you could take the lane, but now I see the logo of a gas station in the street and I magically know that not only can you take the lane here, but also on streets where there are no sharrows."

Of course, my sample size is small, there are probably many people saying this.

Finally, the biggest insult that sharrows give us is that they show that the city is "doing something for cycling." 

Bullshit.

This is just nonsense political cover. It's a waste of money and an insult to cyclists. Shame on those asshole "advocates" who told the cities that this is "all that cyclists want." 

This is because they are so selfish that they don't want to give up an inch of land to the cyclists.

We deserve much more, and we'll get it, but in the meantime, let's stop wasting money on pointless paint.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Turning Tarpit Cycling</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Like moth to the flame or a chronic inflammatory disease, I know I should quit, but I keep breaking out!

Here's a great metaphor for cycling without any infrastructure, a Turning Tarpit: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_tarpit.

"A Turing tarpit is any programming language or computer interface that allows for flexibility in function but is difficult to learn and use because it offers little or no support for common tasks."

Yes!! Just like vehicular cycling!

"Turing tarpits show that theoretical ability is not the same as usefulness in practice."

So just because you can theoretically do something such as ride to work in the middle of a fifty mile per hour lane, it's not necessarily either easy nor desirable!

"Turing tarpits are characterized by having a simple abstract machine which requires the user to deal with many details in the solution of a problem."

These details include anticipating every mood change of every motorist, studying their wheels as well as eye contact, leading a dance, memorizing diagrams on how to place your bicycle to activate a loop detector, proper lane positioning, and much, much more. It makes riding a bike as fun and easy as assembling a NASA rocket with a grade school education and no directions!

Anyway, I know that this is pointless, but I love learning new phrases and I did get a chuckle out of this.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Annoying Cyclists or Local Fusspotism?</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/09/23/annoying-cyclists-or-local-fusspotism/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[LTRs know that one the passions that this blog has is digging deep into the psyches of other people to learn what makes them tick.

In this case, we are going to cover those people who are annoyed at cyclists and who point out that cyclists do some pretty annoying things...

...or do they?

Instead of the whole he said/she said nonsense, I have developed an objective test to see if that local cyclist is really "the biggest danger on the road" or if the problem is all in the wanna be victim's head.

1. How did the cyclist behavior hurt you?

Did she put you in the hospital? Did she kill you? In a worse case scenerio are the two likely? Did she waste your time? If so, how much?

All the adults out there on the road know to expect routine delays which is why this blog suggest that everyone leave a little early to accont for motoring traffic (which wastes 99% of cyclist's, pedestrian's, and motorist's time), cyclists "getting in the way" (far less than 1% of time wasted, but 99% of the time people spend complaining), and even a pedestrian trying to cross the street without "taking her life in her own hands." (sic)

If the cyclist's behavior did not put you at risk, did not waste considerable amounts of your time, and did not, in any other way, put you out, kindly STFU. That cyclist is NOT the biggest danger on the road, and it's bette to be silent than a hystrionic liar.

If your argument is that YOU could have somehow hurt the cyclist, how is it her fault that you put her in danger? Would you feel different if it were a relative of yours with dementia who wandered in your way? If not you're pretty psycho and there's no basis for understanding between us. If so, then realize that you need to be ready to stop at any time, and that there's absolutely no reason to get angry at people when you are the one with the trigger side of the gun.

2. Did the cyclist break the law?

Stop! Please actually READ THE TRAFFIC LAWS AND BE READY TO GIVE A CVC NUMBER (if you are in CA) before you say that the cyclist broke the law.

If you think that there _should_ be a law, but there's not, kindly pester your representative and leave the cycling community out of it. We don't make the laws, and if you have some kind of asshole, punative trash like a "cyclist's license", do you think we want to hear about it?

So, if we didn't hurt you and we didn't break the law then it's not a real problem.

On the other hand, if you were hurt, potentially or otherwise, or we did break the law, I'm sorry.

I'll repeat, WITH THE POWER INVESTED IN ME FROM THE CYCLING COMMUNITY, I'M SORRY. Now, you can kindly call the police and get justice. I will support you. When the police laugh at you, well, wecome to our world.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>24 Hour Fitness Joke (Not!)</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Before I start, I'll make this clear that I LOVE riding outside, and subjectively, I have no problems with my commute; it's a daily joy to me. However, I'm not the only person in the world and thus this post.

Besides the motorist's one joke, there's another joke that's really stale and even less funny because it's not true.

That's the one about where I bike past 24 Hour Fitness each day, and there's all these people who drive so they can ride the excercise bikes inside.

Why not ride a bike, it's the same thing but better.

Haha!

No it's not.

Here's the Bizarro 24 Hour Fitness aka the indoor version of riding on the streets for excercise.

We have the same excercise bikes, but we're going to take away the TV and music. 

OK, that's not so bad, but we're going to yell at each person who tries to listen to his own music for "putting his life in his own hands."

Not only does our friend get shamed for listening to some music--a harmless thing to do--but we're going to play an endless stream of annoying motor sounds.

Next we're going to pump the whole room full of noxious smoke.

Finally, every now and then--not too often, but just enough to have fun--we're going to shoot a cycling customer in the face.

And best of all, if the customer lives to complain, we'll blame him. 

Shouldn't have rode the excercise bikes!

And that my friend is the difference between riding in a comfortable and quiet car to sweat on an excercise bike and the version where you get out there on the streets.

I prefer to ride to work but it's NOT the same, and I do not mock those for riding excercise bikes. (I do mock the customers for many other things, though.) :P]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Finally, a topic that a cyclist can sink her teeth into!

http://deerparkmonastery.org/mindfulness-practice/the-fourteen-mindfulness-trainings

"Aware that true happiness is rooted in peace, solidity, freedom, and compassion, we are determined not to accumulate wealth while millions are hungry and dying..."

Hmmm, I actually disagree with this.

While I do think that charity is important and that one should help others and not let wealth make one arrogant, I don't know if this is a healthy attitude towards money.

One of the many gifts that my princess gave me was a more realistic view of money.

Money is power, and it's necessary to making good changes. To say that money is dirty is to say that power is dirty and the will to change things is dirty which means that we'll all be passive and let greedy assholes run the world.

Not a good idea!

Better to accumulate money and power through ethical means and use these things to help others.

Let's continue:

"...nor to take as the aim of our life fame, power, wealth, or sensual pleasure, which can bring much suffering and despair."

Yes! This is true. Although I am a hedonist (hi sensual pleasure, how I love thee), I do realize that this is limited which is why I am trying to meditate harder than ever. That is I want to meditate harder, I'm doing so-so.

Next up:

"...We are committed not to gamble or to use alcohol, drugs..."

OK, here it's a total loss for me. I'll admit it. I like these things. Do they interfere with my practice! Yes. More on this later, I don't want to turn this post into an AA meeting. Overall, though I do think that drugs can be a positive or a negative experience. If I had more commitment, I'd not use them. I don't. 

On the other hand, I don't do guilt so I'm happy like I am.

"...or any other products which bring toxins into our own and the collective body and consciousness such as certain websites, electronic games, music, TV programs, films, magazines, books and conversations."

Don't want to turn this into a confessional, but guilty of all these things. I like gossip and dirt. They make me superficially happy.

"We will consume in a way that preserves compassion, wellbeing, and joy in our bodies and consciousness and in the collective body and consciousness of our families, our society, and the earth." [The End]

What!?

No mention of bicycles!

So disappointed. I think I whined about this before, the lame ass denial that Buddhists have regarding transportation.

If you are not going to kill ants and to give up alcohol due to compassion why pollute the atmosphere and kill animals via road kill?

I like meditation, but I can't take Buddhist teachers seriously until they get on a bike. Otherwise, any talk of mindfulness or compassion is totally rubbish.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Regression to Randomness</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/10/01/regression-to-randomness/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[OK, I have a lot of random thoughts which aren't a proper post.

First of all, on the veto of the Three Foot Passing Law: I don't think it should have been vetoed.

I do agree that the governor has chosen to toss out a few lives for the sake of a potential lawsuit. I think that this is one of the most selfish things I have ever heard of.

On the other hand, I do agree that people should not cross a double yellow line to pass. THAT'S WHY YOU WAIT UNTIL IT'S SAFE TO OVERTAKE BEFORE YOU DO SO.

I don't know why the simple things I learned from driver's ed are being debated endlessly now a days. Was I the only one who learned that sometimes you have to drive slower than you'd like for a short time until it's safe?

Perhaps this is due to my driving in semi-rural places where there were roads that were 50 MPH and single lane and went for many miles. Often there were slow drivers and blind curves. If I cross the double yellow line to pass a tractor and I get hurt will I sue the state for this? No.

Idiots!

That is until I hear about the whiny complaints regarding the destruction of local business when traffic calming occurs. First of all, this has been proven false, but on the face of it, the standard disgusts me. If you need to have cyclists die to make a buck that's a strange thing to argue about. If I was this selfish, I wouldn't tell people.

I also think that it's silly that bicycles have to have the standard of not slowing down motorists, ever. We all need to wait for one another. 

Whether we do so patiently or not is our own choice of suffering.

Also, on the 
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/27/nyregion/in-reversal-new-york-city-traffic-fatalities-rise.html?_r=1">increased NYC traffic deaths.</a>

Apparently, they have not studied stats from a century ago.

It's called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean">regression to the mean.</a>

"In statistics, regression toward the mean (also known as regression to the mean) is the phenomenon that if a variable is extreme on its first measurement, it will tend to be closer to the average on a second measurement, and—a fact that may superficially seem paradoxical—if it is extreme on a second measurement, will tend to have been closer to the average on the first measurement.[1][2][3] To avoid making wrong inferences, the possibility of regression toward the mean must be considered when designing experiments and interpreting experimental, survey, and other empirical data in the physical, life, behavioural and social sciences."

Basically, the decrease in traffic accidents could have been a fluke or the increase this year is a fluke. We won't know for a few more years.

Things like this is why it's hard to say things such as "bike lanes are safe" or whatever. You need to design the studies with good stats first rather than getting some random data and making lots of conclusions from it.

Finally, I liked this article about the <a href="http://pricetags.wordpress.com/2012/09/20/cashing-in-why-bike-lanes-dont-create-costs-for-cars/">cost of cycling.</a>

"Mr. Toderian, now an independent planning consultant, said bike routes are the only aspect of the city’s entire transportation puzzle that the public and the media tend to talk about."]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Mindfulness Cycling 6/14</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Originally, I was going to call this post, "Raging Cyclist" and cover all the emotions in cycling. I think I'll still do this, but this happened to connect with the next Mindfulness Training:  The Sixth Mindfulness Training: Taking Care of Anger

I read this here:

http://www.amazon.com/The-Urban-Cyclists-Survival-Guide/product-reviews/B007F83M5K/ref=cm_cr_dp_synop/176-1654144-3910529?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=0&amp;sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending#R1IB3T82G497DY


"Atomic Grrrrrl (Brooklyn, NY USA) 

...Let me explain: there's a huge problem in the cycling community right now, one that threatens to ruin the cycling movement in this country if it isn't nipped in the bud. For some reason, there's a small contingent of people who develop into the Raging Cyclist. This is a person who has a bad experience or two with a motorist, pedestrian, etc. Or maybe, due to personal problems, he or she has decided to play his frustrations out on the road. Next thing you know, this person develops an overtly negative, almost poisonous hatred of anyone who isn't a cyclist. An "attitude" then develops in which he sees himself in some type of "battle zone" where everyone's an "enemy", everything's personal, everyone's out to "get him". Next thing you know, he develops the type of road rage where he's screaming randomly at pedestrians, smashing windshields, or getting into verbal confrontations with motorists."

I love this because I thought, "Yes". I was this person. Thanks Atomic Grrrrrl, if that's your real name. :)

She continues:

"I don't have to tell you why Raging Cyclists like that are terrible. For one, they give the cycling community a bad name. Two, they give motorists who are already "on the edge" all the justification they need to run down an innocent cyclist who may be the most courteous person in the world but for all the motorist knows, is no different than the person who smashed his side mirror the other day. Three, they're a bad influence on newbies, who are taught to become as angry as they are. This results in more "angry cyclists" to swell their ranks, who then act poorly when they ride, which further denigrates the community in the eyes of non-cyclists."

For some reasons, this is something to be concerned about, but as Russell Brand said, "The only thing you should really worry about is getting enough to eat and being kind to others...and perhaps some sex."

"The Urban Cyclist's Survival Guide should be commended for trying to do something--however minor-- to combat this problem by stressing a zen-like attitude when riding."

I love it because this is exactly what I decided to do after getting buzzed by four cars in a row right in front of Disney Land. I was so scared that I thought that they'd have Mickey Mouse out there giving me mouth to mouth.

I find that if I totally ignore cars, emotionally, espescially those who buzz me by passing two closely (Thanks Jerry Brown!), I feel better. Plus, I noticed that in general, the cars actually get freaked out. Not the cars, really, but the motorists inside. At least they give me more room after this.

Let's see what the Buddhists have to say about anger.

"When anger manifests, we are determined not to do or say anything, but to practice mindful breathing or mindful walking to acknowledge, embrace, and look deeply into our anger."

That's nice, but I find that I actually will just ignore the anger. I don't know if it's practice or what, but usually this works.

It didn't that time that guy deliberately hit me, but then again, that was another less to me that if _I_ had not reacted, the day would have gone better.

I feel that any reaction at all to assholes is a win for them. If it hurts me that they are so callous imagine what it does to them when they try to "teach me a lesson" aka give me a good scare and it does not work.

Also, the Buddhists believe that your emotional state when you die plays a huge role in where you will end up. That is, if you are caught up in anger before you die, you'll go to hell. I keep this in mind when people are buzzing me. For those of you who do not believe in superstitious nonsense, I can't help you. I learned, a few years ago that there are bad delusions and good ones...

More from Buddhism:

"We know that the roots of anger are not outside of ourselves but can be found in our wrong perceptions and lack of understanding of the suffering in ourselves and others."

Yes! I love this line.

"We know that the roots of anger are not outside of ourselves but can be found in our wrong perceptions and lack of understanding of the suffering in ourselves and others."

This can work. It takes years, but you, too, can have less anger.

One thing in this training I did not like was the whole notion of anger as being the enemy.

I like the idea that all of our emotions are assets including fear, anger, and even depression. 

It's all in how you use the emotion.

Also, Thich Nat Hahn had said in an earlier book, _Being Peace_, that when you are angry, you are your anger. So to fight the anger is to fight yourself. This calmed me down even more so.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Helmetlessness: Calculated Vulnerability</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I so loved this
<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCIQtwIwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DiCvmsMzlF7o&amp;ei=0LFwUITANo2dqQH4tIGwCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFVvwbjqWe7KKqxdnOfFCcOiipVIA&amp;sig2=gPRxz6_D5gGG2t4X0kUh9w"> talk on vulnerability, </a>I'm going to watch it again.

Like most talks, and books I read these days, I filter it though my prism of a bicycle blog article so here we go.

My favorite part about this talk was when she talked about becoming vulnerable to people in order to connect with them.

I thought, "Yes!"

Two often, in the helmet debate, people are talking past one another. One side points out that cyclists without helmets are more relatable and more human.

The other side says, "But, but you are more vulnerable."

Yes! We become more relatable and more human by becoming more vulnerable.

There's not much more too it.

I know that the other side is looking at crash stats and seeing the head shaking of an ER doc who's repurposed as an expert on how not to live aka don't so anything fun.

This kind of injury is exactly what vulnerable is.

So why become vulnerable?

We don't have to.

We can cover ourselves with armor, do the right thing, at all times. Shun any kind of mind enhancing experience and keep our fears and pain to ourselves.

If we do this, we are likely to be hurt less, but we live less, too.

The ultimate in safety is to lock ourselves in a tomb.

I think that instead, we need to live. To get out there and to embrace some calculated and low risks.

To make ourselves vulnerable.

We might find that in the process our shared humanity allows us to surround ourselves with friends and allies.

Those who are occasionally and intelligently vulnerable might just be stronger than those who have locked themselves in a fortress while the latter might become prisoners in their own castles.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'm confused by your comment, Steve.

My point was that not wearing a helmet made you look more vulnerable.

Do you agree or disagree with this?

The idea of "fortress" was to show that the whole notion of helmet was safety. Agree or no.

See one of the most annoying phrases that pro-helmet people, when shown how useless that helmets are in many cases, is things like "you never know, or it's always better to be safe."

Again, I question this premise.

I didn't actually think that people in helmets were in a literal fortress. Is this what you thought my post meant?

Perhaps I didn't write it very clearly.

Sorry to confuse you.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[You are making me forget my original point.

I didn't want to debate the actual relative vulnerability of motorists nor cyclists with or without helmets.

My original point was that we can often connect with others by selectively showing vulnerability.

I was connecting this finding with my desire to connect with the wider community in all modes while on my bicycle.

It has nothing to do with whether someone needs to wear a helmet. The "fortress" analogy was based upon the notion that many people have that it's socially unacceptable to take any risks which means that it's socially unacceptable to have any kind of vulnerability.

Not wearing a helmet makes one APPEAR more vulnerable and can be seen as an attempt to connect with others.

Furthermore, I noted that while APPEARING (not statistical NOT advocacy wise vulnerable), one could gain allies and that they might be safer, as a group, in the long run than those who adopt the seemingly rational, but ultimately insane obsession with safety at all cots.

Congrats, you inspired me to re-write my blog post.

I really hope you do understand this, simple idea, Steve.

You are a kind person, but I sometimes get super-frustrated in communicating with you.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[We continue this series:

http://deerparkmonastery.org/mindfulness-practice/the-fourteen-mindfulness-trainings

The Seventh Mindfulness Training: Dwelling Happily in the Present Moment

OK, let me clear something up about this whole "present moment" stuff.

I'm often asked how to be happy in the present moment and plan at the same time.

To me this is silly.

You can plan in the present moment.

And "being in the present", to me, is pointless if you can't plan for a future, too.

I just don't see a contradiction. I don't think that being "in the present" and not thinking of the future at all is a wise way to live.

Also, I find that I love to day dream, and I encourage myself to do this as much as possible.

I think that mindfulness comes in when we are getting sucked into some mental spaces where we don't want to be. The idea of mindfulness is that we realize that we are not our thoughts and that we don't have to believe everything that we think.

Let's see what the Mindfulness Training has to say:

"We will try not to lose ourselves in dispersion or be carried away by regrets about the past, worries about the future, or craving, anger, or jealousy in the present. We will practice mindful breathing to be aware of what is happening in the here and the now."

I like this, but I don't always use the breath on a bicycle. I find that sound is a really good object for cycling especially when I can listen to white noise and cars passing me.

"We are determined to learn the art of mindful living by touching the wondrous, refreshing, and healing elements that are inside and around us, in all situations."

I really like this. It's kind of vague, but it seems like a good idea to try to find these elements while on a bicycle. Still, I'd like something more specific here.

"We are aware that real happiness depends primarily on our mental attitude and not on external conditions, and that we can live happily in the present moment simply by remembering that we already have more than enough conditions to be happy."

I really like this as well. I try to be happy where ever I cycle though some places suck more than others.

A final thing about cycling is that I often solve work related problems while on my bicycle even though I don't make an effort to do so. A co-worker thinks that this is because cycling drives more oxygen and blood to my brain. Probably. I thought it was that my subconscious mind worked harder on stuff while my conscious mind was working on other things like not dying.

Perhaps it's a bit of both.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Analysis of Australian Mandatory Helmet Law I</title>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Australia is an interesting case study due to the fact that in 1991, there was a mandatory helmet law for all cyclists.

Thus, we can compare the results before and after cycling.

First I looked at this <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CB8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.infrastructure.gov.au%2Froads%2Fsafety%2Fpublications%2F2006%2Fpdf%2Fdeath_cyclists_road.pdf&amp;ei=M3BzUPH1BNDciQL5uIGwCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHm_FcC7FBK5xw88m3szn-0pzdeuQ&amp;sig2=ioTToVw9LyBDi28TcZK4Og">paper on cyclist's deaths.</a>

Analysis of Australian Mandatory Helmet Law

First of all, due disclosure: I am biased against helmets for reasons that I blogged about in the past.

While I do think that they might help in certain cases, I don't think that a helmet that has not passed the Snell test will give a w orthwhile improvement in safety especially given a high speed motor vehicle collision.

Here's something to <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CB8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.americawalks.org%2Fwp-content%2Fupload%2FSpeed2.pdf&amp;ei=xIJzUJvJLMneqgGm7YE4&amp;usg=AFQjCNEkWk3NiZbW-ND1f0Bi6cc8EicCnQ&amp;sig2=VVTpeI3GrErqZzJ0kORkSA">chew on.</a>

"If a pedestrian is hit by a vehicle that is traveling 20 mph, the pedestrian survival rate is 95 percent. This drops to 60 percent at 30 mph, and just 20 percent at 40 mph."

Since most pedestrians do not wear helmets, I believe that we can say the same for unhelmeted cyclists. Thus, we can presume that of the cyclists killed, about 60% were probably killed by motor vehicles going 30 MPH or more.

Even many of the pro-helmet people agree that bicycle helmets tend to be useless in high speed motor vehicle collisions.

In order to avoid begging the question, logical error, we have to ask ourselves whether helmets actually save lives or not.

Let's do this another way. If we had a mystery factor, such as alcohol use or lack of cycling skill called factor X, we can do a study to see if it saves lives or not.

What if there is a high incidence of factor X with cyclist's deaths. We'd be insane to say that factor X saved lives, right?

No.

We are insane.

If you a had a list of cyclists who were dead in Australia between '96 and 2000, a cyclist is more likely than not to be wearing a helmet.

IN A 5 YEAR PERIOD IN AUSTRALIA, CYCLISTS WHO DIED WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE WEARING A HELMET.

From the Australian paper on cyclists death.

"From 1996 to 2000, nearly one-third of all male cyclists and nearly half of male cyclists in the 10 to 19 age group killed in road crashes were not wearing a helmet. Similarly, nearly one-third of all female cyclists killed in road crashes in the period were not wearing a helmet."

We would be naive to say that helmets CAUSED the deaths. But this is precisely what the papers which "prove" that helmets are safe will do.

They find that retrospectively, there are more cyclists who are dead without helmets then they will conclude that the difference was because helmets "saved lives".

Again, I'm not saying that helmets do or do not save lives, but if only one third cyclists die in a five year period without a helmet and two thirds with helmets die, it's hard to make a case that helmets are that effective in saving lives.

Why this point is not made louder is due to the mental block called "begging the question" which means that we assume a conclusion in our premises.

It's worth noting that the 18 cyclists who died sans helmet were breaking the law. Thus, the effect might have been that most cyclists were wearing helmets due to the law which explained the high number of helmeted corpses.

Still, there's a significant number of dead cyclists who chose to wear a helmet. In light of this, I propose that to blame a cyclist who is injured for not wearing a helmet is in error.

Also, I'd like for the pro-helmet people to defend and explain the high death rate among their head cushion wearing brothers. Why so high? 

Again, we know that more people were wearing helmets, but perhaps we are barking up the wrong tree if we mandate a silly looking, uncomfortable, and expensive piece of gear and we still lose DOUBLE those who don't wear helmets.

Things get more troubling when we see that my above premise is true: high speeds kill cyclists:

"In each of the 5-year periods since 1990, the largest proportions of cyclist deaths have occurred on roads where the speed limit was 60 km/h: 55 per cent in 1991–95, 42 per cent in 1996–00 and 35 per cent in 2001–05."

So lowering the speed limit could have saved half the cyclists.

Thus, here's (besides cyclists themselves) is the biggest causualty of the obsession with plastic head buckets, the distraction from actual measures that save cyclists lives.

From the above, we can see that cyclists with a helmet on can very well die. 

However, if the speed limit is 20 MPH, the death rate falls to FIVE PERCENT.

Thus, every second we waste on helmets is another lost opportunity for speeding motorists to kill cyclists WHETHER WE HAVE HELMETS ON OR NOT.

IN OTHER WORDS, THE OBSESSION WITH HELMETS DISTRACTS THE GOVERNMENT FROM ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSES OF MOST CYCLIST'S DEATHS WHICH IS HIGH SPEED MOTORISTS.

I don't have time to find the paper, but it's a fact that speed limits do not work. The only thing that slows down fast motorists is well designed infrastructure. Separating cyclists (again infrastructure) also saves lives.

What about "classes" to teach us to cycle better.

Ken Cross would be proud because these classes would get you killed, head bucket or no, in Australia:

"The most common type of crash in which cyclists were fatally injured was the cyclist being hit from behind by a motor vehicle travelling in the same lane in the same direction...This kind of crash occurred in urban as well as in rural areas but 38 cases occurred on rural roads, most during the day."

I'll put this in all caps for the thick: MOST DEATHS IN AUSTRALIA OCCURRED DURING THE DAY BY THOSE WHO "TOOK THE LANE".

I love it because there's a big obsession for people to dismiss these deaths in the Cross study as those who were hit at night by those who had no lights. Not anymore. 

Note to MADD lovers, if Australia has a version of MADD, they are not needed:

"in nearly 90 per cent of the cases where it was known, BAC was found to be zero."

Thus, if factor X is alcohol, you are more likely to NOT be drunk that drunk and hit a cyclist.

Again, I'm not arguing that alcohol prevents acccidents, but if the data were reversed, and 90% of motorists were intoxicated, we'd say that alcohol was an issue.

Tomorrow, I look at this <a href="http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/52030">paper which tries to compare arm injuries to head injuries to make a point.</a>]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I have two Snell-rated helmets. One I wear in the car. The other is a bicycle helmet that was made to standards similar to the poor CPSC standard. It is quite true that the evidence that helmets affect cyclist fatalities is sketchy, but that is true for most things involving cyclists. Including what cyclists were doing when hit.

  <title>Analysis of Australian Mandatory Helmet Law II</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[First, I'll quickly digress for a moment.

I'M NOT ADVOCATING RIDING A BICYCLE WITHOUT A HELMET. 

If you feel that you need a helmet because you are racing, mountain biking, or otherwise pushing yourself, kindly wear one.

However, I am not going to entertain stories where, "I fell off my bike once and my helmet broke. That would have been my head!" stories.

If cycling were made safe by building proper infrastructure, cycling deaths would be so absurdly low that talk about a helmet would be ludicrous.

The problem occurs when the discussion becomes all about helmets IN PLACE OF INFRASTRUCTURE.

That's exactly what happened in Australia.

Instead of traffic calming, something that would have inconvenience motorists and cost them lots of money, they took the cheap way out. Because of this, a lot of people died.

I'll say this again, CARPING ON HELMETS WHILE IGNORING INFRASTRUCTURE IS KILL PEOPLE.

So next time, you hear the nonsensical, "he died because people told him not to wear a helmet", think about this.

Of the 222 cyclicts who died in Australia, 

Further, if we look at this paper (http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CB8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.infrastructure.gov.au%2Froads%2Fsafety%2Fpublications%2F2006%2Fpdf%2Fdeath_cyclists_road.pdf&amp;ei=M3BzUPH1BNDciQL5uIGwCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHm_FcC7FBK5xw88m3szn-0pzdeuQ&amp;sig2=ioTToVw9LyBDi28TcZK4Og ) on page 5 note the speed limit of the cyclists that died.

There are 665 total deaths. Of these, only 6 died in 40 km (about 20 MPH in the US) zones or less. Again: IN FIFTEEN YEARS, ONLY SIX CYCLISTS DIED IN 20 MPH ZONES OR LESS.

Thus, high speed roads killed 659 cyclists in a fifteen year period. Thus, the helmet law which gave Australians a false sense of security killed 659 people. Thus, one can argue that by distracting from real safety improvements, helmet promoters are not doing anything to save cyclists lives.

This is why helmet promotion is so bad. HELMET PROMOTION IS A CHEAP DISTRACTION FROM REAL SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS. The main thing that the helmet debate does is drain energy away from real safety promotion. One more time, IF AUSTRALIA HAD LOWERED THEIR SPEED LIMIT IN CYCLING AREAS INSTEAD OF SLAPPING HELMETS ON THEIR CYCLIST'S HEADS, THEY WOULD HAVE SAVED OVER SIX HUNDRED LIVES.

In spite of this great data, the silly people who wrote the text to the above paper obsessed over a plastic bucket designed to protect children who fall off their bicycles. In the vast majority of the cycling fatalities, helmets are useless.

  <title>Analysis of Australian Mandatory Helmet Law III</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/10/11/analysis-of-australian-mandatory-helmet-law-iii/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[OK, day three, I might actually get to the original paper.

Before I get into it, let's got through the pro-helmet fall back positions.

1. Helmets save many lives.

2. Even if they can't be proven to save lives, they save some lives.

3. OK, even if they don't save lives, they prevent minor injuries and scrapes on the scalp.

4. Wearing a helmet can't hurt, at least, so it's better to be safe than sorry.

I have addressed the above before, but I'll restate my argument against #4.

Recall when Steve Jobs got cancer, and he tried alternative medicine? http://gawker.com/5849543/harvard-cancer-expert-steve-jobs-probably-doomed-himself-with-alternative-medicine

"Harvard Cancer Expert: Steve Jobs Probably Doomed Himself With Alternative Medicine"

I propose, that helmets are the quack medicine of road safety.

But it gets worse!

When weighing on whether one should personally wear a helmet or not, it is assumed that the helmet has almost no cost and that the potential benefit is one's life. Thus, it seems absurd to NOT wear a helmet.

Not so fast!

Helmets are actually quite expensive.

Let's just say that only 10% of Australians ever cycle (http://www.cycle-helmets.com/cycling-1985-2011.html).

This means that out of roughly 22 million people, we have 2.2 million cyclists. If each of them buys a single helmet in their lifetimes, they will spend $66,000,000 on cycling helmets. Again: CYCLISTS IN AUSTRALIA SPENT ROUGHLY SIXTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN CYCLING HELMETS.

If they spent the money on political candidates alone, they could buy any election.

Or imagine that money were used in infrastructure?

I have previously proven that lower speed limits or creating separate infrastructure will save many lives. Thus, SPENDING ON HELMETS IS PISSING AWAY MONEY WHICH CAN BE USED TO SAVE LIVES ON SNAKE OIL.

In terms of time, if people only spent five minutes buying, maintaining, checking, and replacing helmets, you'd wind up with a solid 20 wasted man/years (thats time in years of a single person working for 20 years or 20 people working for a full year without breaks nor sleep) on helmets safety. Imagine if you spent the 20 man/years of labor on something, anything else. Again, these are bare minimum numbers.

This doesn't count the number of academics who are studying helmets and writing papers on them.

Some of the studies have come out which say that helmets are actually not only useless for saving one from most fatality situations, but they are also useless for their intended use: 

"The Cochrane Collaboration and bicycle helmets. Accid. Anal. Prev. 37, 569–573] disputing a conclusion of a Cochrane Collaboration review, namely, that it establishes scientific evidence that all types of standard bicycle helmet protect against injury to the brain. In response to the conclusion of Cummings that the review's case–control studies provide such evidence, I explain that their design is inadequate to do this."

http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457506001758

Furthermore, researchers are on to the bullshit notion that helmets cost nothing and provide tons of protection:

"The main ground of rebuttal is that my critics take the relevant efficacy of helmets as given and argue from there." [AKA begging the question.]

  <title>Analysis of Australian Mandatory Helmet Law IV</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[OK, here's the original paper that started this whole series of blog posts (thanks anti-cycling, mandatory helmet law making Australian parliament for making a series of spicy blog posts instead of the boring ones about cycling and spirituality.) :)

http://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/fapi/datastream/unsworks:10700/SOURCE01

Reading the abstract alone is a great example on how NOT to do research:

"The results suggest that the initial observed benefit of MHL has been maintained over the ensuing decades."

LTRs know that I disagree with this, but we'll swing back to this one. Abstract continues:

"There is a notable additional safety benefit after 2006 that is associated with an increase in cycling infrastructure spending. This implies that the effect of MHL is ongoing and progress in cycling safety in NSW has and will continue to benefit from focusing on broader issues such as increasing cycling infrastructure."

When you have a single effect caused by more than one variable, the name for that is confounding.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding

"In statistics, a confounding variable (also confounding factor, hidden variable, lurking variable, a confound, or confounder) is an extraneous variable in a statistical model that correlates (positively or negatively) with both the dependent variable and the independent variable. Such a relation between two observed variables is termed a spurious relationship. In the case of risk assessments evaluating the magnitude and nature of risk to human health, it is important to control for confounding to isolate the effect of a particular hazard such as a food additive, pesticide, or new drug."

This is bad.

However, there is a way out. 

Since Australia only got significant infrastructure in 2006, we have the golden period between 1991 and 2006 in which we can look at the change in head protection from injury from helmets.

From the paper:

"Fig. 1 indicates the rate of divergence between head and arm injuries increases from 2006 onwards. It was during this period that significant financial investment by various local NSW governments were being made and continued in the second half of the decade. Montoya (2010) points out that a total of $AUD29.3 million was
spent by the then New South Wales state government Roads and Traffic Authority on bicycle facilities in 2008–09."

Previously, I have show that nearly all deaths can be explained by the cyclist getting hit by a car at such a speed that a helmet saving their life is out of the question. This was reinforced by the nearly two to one ratio of those who died with a helmet over those who died without one. Also, I don't know how much money a helmet costs in Australia, but it seems that in comparison to costs for helmets in the US, they paid peanuts for infrastructure.

Yet, if you look at the Fig.1 graph, after a drop off in 1991 when the mandatory helmet law (MHL) was introduced, we get a flat number of head injuries until 2006. 

Let's look at that so called dramatic drop:

"The first year of the mandatory bicycle helmet laws in Australia saw increased helmet wearing from 31% to 75% of cyclists in Victoria and from 31% of children and 26% of adults in New South Wales (NSW) to 76% and 85%. However, the two major surveys using matched before and after samples in Melbourne (Finch et al. 1993; Report No. 45, Monash Univ. Accident Research Centre) and throughout NSW (Smith and Milthorpe 1993; Roads and Traffic Authority) observed reductions in numbers of child cyclists 15 and 2.2 times greater than the increase in numbers of children wearing helmets. This suggests the greatest effect of the helmet law was not to encourage cyclists to wear helmets, but to discourage cycling." ( http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0001457596000164 )

Thus, the helmet laws mostly discouraged cycling.

But, you might argue, I am not in favor of a MHL, but I think that for "insurance purposes" and because it's "better to be safe than sorry", I will still personally encourage any cyclist to wear a helmet.

I would argue, that if you do this, you are creating a mini-version of the MHL on a per person basis.

We don't like the reduction in the number of cyclists because of MHL, why create a mini-version of this.

MHL did not save lives, it prevented the government from acting in ways that actually do save lives.

Helmets are a HUGE, HUGE industry with millions in profits for a device that is next to useless in any significant accident.

Wearing a helmet has caused a false sense of security. This false sense of security is not only dangerous to cyclists, but a helmet has been implicated in at least one pedestrian death where the cyclist mentioned that he was confindent in taking risks due to his helmet. This allowed him to feel confident enough to run a red light and to kill someone: 

'The light turned yellow as I was approaching the intersection, but I was already way too committed to stop. The light turned red as I was cruising through the middle of the intersection and then, almost instantly, the southern crosswalk on Market and Castro filled up with people coming from both directions...I couldn't see a line through the crowd and I couldn't stop, so I laid it down and just plowed through the crowded crosswalk in the least-populated place I could find.

I remember seeing a RIVER of blood on the asphalt, but it wasn't mine. I really hope he ends up OK."

Dedicating the post to his now-broken helmet, the author wrote, "may she die knowing that because she committed the ultimate sacrifice, her rider and live and ride on. Can I get an amen? Amen.' (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/25/chris-bucchere-cyclist-charged-felony_n_1452946.html)

How many other cyclists have died due to a false sense of security? We don't know.

Finally, helmets waste tons of time and money that could be used to make things actually safe. Australia has gotten a downward trend in head injuries due to a tiny bit of infrastructure spending which ENCOURAGES cycling while they got a minimal or even negative head safety improvement by passing a law to DISCOURAGE cycling.

Let's make cycling safe, for real, in ways that we cen measure.

Let's stop telling each other fairy tales. 

If we want to wear a helmet, wear it.

But I say that the money is better spent on lobbying for safer streets which will benefit all of us instead of a helmet which will go to a landfill in a few years with dubious or possibly negative benefit to us all.

  <title>Helmet Industry's Response to Being Useless</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[In the normal universe, if you have a drug which claims to reduce heart attacks, for example, and you saturate the at-risk population and find that it does not work, you will stop giving that drug.

When the drug is helmets, the helmet is ALWAYS right.

There is no standard you can use to show that helmets are useless.

Case and point is Bell Sports.

http://www.double-forte.com/results/case_study/bell_sports/

"Research from the Consumer Product Safety Commission showed that while bike helmet use among children was on the rise so were head injuries among young bike riders."

This shows that helmets are useless.

Did Bell just give up and admit that their product was less than dangerous like any other safety device which tricks you into putting your life into its hands and then it gives out on you?

Hell, no. They doubled down on their safety claims by blaming their customers for their injuries!

"Bell Sports sought a campaign to educate parents about proper helmet use while positioning the brand as the leader in consumer helmet safety."

This is one of the many reasons why I find the word "education" in relation to cycling to be toxic.

"Education" sounds good or at worse benign, but that's far from being true.

If Bell is going to take this tact, you can NEVER win because there will always be one more detail that they forgot to mention which makes helmets SUPER-SAFE.

Right now, basically, the helmet industry is saying that either helmets are too complicated for a normal person to figure out w/o "special training" or that their customers are stupid. :)

Outside of a independent study, we can't know if helmets are useful if "used properly" or not.

But we do know that out of the box, most people do not use them to Bell's standards and thus helmet wearing actually puts people in danger. This is a HUGE admission from the helmet industry.

I am curious now and I'd like more details on what is it that people were doing wrong exactly in putting on something as simple as a helmet that they were putting themselves at greater risk.

And next time people tell you that a helmet is like a seatbelt, you might want to look into that, too:

  <title>Cycling Helmets Do Far, Far, Far More Harm than Good</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[LTRs can skip this. 

In this article, I restate my earlier claims and cut n' paste from a single article.

OK, I seem like I'm obsessed with helmets. That's because I am.

The more I dig, the more more I find that helmets are actually a potential form of risk. (I do suggest reading the whole article and perhaps just skipping this blog post):

http://www.bmj.com/content/332/7543/722.2?tab=responses

I have mentioned that helmeted riders will intentionally and even worse, unintentionally take more risks.

Here's an example where a helmet is implicated in a man who is paralysed. He has stated that if he did NOT have a helmet, he would not have taken a risk that has put him in a wheelchair.

"One such example was reported in the New York Times . In August 1999, Philip Dunham, then 15, was riding his mountain bike in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and went over a jump on a trail. As he did, his back tire kicked up, the bike flipped over and he landed on his head. The helmet he was wearing did not protect his neck and he was paralysed from the neck down. Two years later, Philip has regained enough movement and strength in his arms to use a manual wheelchair. He has also gained some perspective. With the helmet he felt protected enough to ride off-road on a challenging trail. In hindsight, perhaps too safe. "It didn't cross my mind that this could happen," said Philip, now 17. "I definitely felt safe. I wouldn't do something like that without a helmet." 

The name of the above series of comments, from the BMJ, is called: "No clear evidence from countries that have enforced the wearing of helmets".

This should cause us pause. Why is there "no clear evidence"?

I'd say that if the effects of helmets on injuries is so small that the best attempts to measure it have failed, that it does not exist. There was certainly no 85% decrease in injuries which is the claim that can be found in many, many places.

The predictions of some of the most frequently cited papers:

Dorsch, 1987 	-90% fatalities
Thompson, Rivara, Thompson, 1989 	-85% head injuries, -88% brain injuries
Wasserman, 1990 	-29% concussions, -82% skull fractures
McDermott, 1993 	-39% head injuries,
but no significant reduction for adults
Thompson, Rivara, Thompson, 1996 	-69% head injuries, -65% brain injuries
Table 1
Injury savings predicted by case-control studies 

http://www.cyclehelmets.org/1139.html

There are a few things I'd like from the pro-helmet crowd. 

1. Clear data that shows that helmets work as intended and save lives. I'd like to know how many lives and in what circumstances.

2. I'd like to know where helmets are not intended to work. What are some scenerios where a helmet is known to fail? An example of this is sky diving. I don't expect to live if I jump out of a 50 story building and land on my head. If the speed that helmets help me is in collisions with cars of 20 MPH or less, I have to say that unhelmeted pedestrians will survive 95% of the time. To reduce a risk below that is not worth the hassle.

I do not think that "safety in numbers" is a good reason to argue for helmets at all because it looks bad. That is, to say that we need to downplay helmets because it causes people not to cycle is not a good argument because it implies that we are lying to people and putting them at risk just to make cycling unpopular.

A better argument is that "helmets are useless. If you like helmets you must be for less expensive infrastructure improvements that actually work."

If you really would like a laugh look at table three in the above link:

"Naive approaches simply reporting trends as effects of helmet laws (as in the Canadian study) would lead to the conclusion that bike helmet laws also prevent pedestrian injuries (Fig 3) A more plausible explanation is that helmet-law provinces also introduced other measures (e.g. speed cameras or random breath tests) and that they improved safety for all road users."

Thus, claims of protection by helmets are, as I said earlier, are confounded by real increases in road safety. Thus, pedestrian injuries and fatalities should be accounted for when we argue that increased wearing of helmets saves lives.

But there's more!

"Rotational injuries from sports helmets are a recognised problem: "The use of helmets increases the size and mass of the head. This may result in an increase in brain injury by a number of mechanisms. Blows that would have been glancing become more solid and thus transmit increased rotational force to the brain. These forces result in shearing stresses on neurones which may result in concussion and other forms of brain injury." Experiments on monkeys show that rotational forces cause much more severe brain injuries than linear forces."

Here's a response to the story that "I fell off my bike and my helmet broke."

(from the above article)

"Because of the difficulty finding adults who crashed or fell off their bikes, 86% of the community controls (CC) were children under 15.[2] At the time, a large observational survey in Seattle showed that 3.2% of child cyclists wore helmets, compared to 21.1% of children in the CC group.[3]

If, as Ms Thompson suggests, these helmet wearing rates are correct, it would seem that helmeted children fall off their bikes 7 times more often than non-wearers. There would be no point in recommending helmet wearing, because helmet wearers seem to have many more injuries than non-wearers.

Why should helmet wearers have more accidents? Clarke details how helmet use can lead to more head impacts plus additional accidents.[4] Thompson's approach to helmet research appears to assume that differences in head injury rates were due to helmets."

"These cycling numbers should be compared with WA cyclist hospital admissions in the years pre and post law enforcement:

1985 - 623

1986 - 660

1987 - 630

1988 - 698

1989 - 596

1990 - 638

1991 - 730

1992 - 574

1993 - 633

1994 - 644

1995 - 660

1996 - 715

1997 - 754

1998 - 850

1999 - 862

2000 - 913

There was no decline in overall cyclist hospital admissions despite the traffic surveys showing a ~30% decline in cyclists on the roads (more than 50% reduction in schoolchildren cycling from 1991 to 1996). "

"As Robinson shows, there is solid reason to doubt the likely benefits of the monomaniacal focus on cycle helmets which currently dominates much "cycle safety" policy, and genuine cause for concern as to the effects of the relentless portrayal of cycling as dangerous which underpins helmet promotion."]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Defining Acceptable Risk of Cycling</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[FYI, yesterday, I went to a TEDx talk which gave me tons of ideas. I'd like to share some in this post. I'll give proper attribution, I just want the reader to know where this comes from.

Also, for the past few days, I have been obsessing over this paper:

"Acceptable Risk by the World Wide Health Organization"

http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCMQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.who.int%2Fentity%2Fwater_sanitation_health%2Fdwq%2Fiwachap10.pdf&amp;ei=JA17UPCiAYrNqQHS-oEo&amp;usg=AFQjCNEoDySwLJxsz8cHQTGpe7w8ge2-bQ&amp;sig2=o9ZHcibSwsMzrYxCLn6FKg

The reason that I found this paper if because one of the biggest question and one of the most contentious is how dangerous is cycling?

I have written, on separate occasions, about how safety cycling is and how dangerous it is.

Well, what is it?

Is a five foot guy short or tall? If he's twenty years old then he's short, but if he's two then he's a giant!

Cycling safety is the same way.

Everyone has their own agenda for it. Many cyclists would like for cycling to be seen as dangerous enough to build protected infrastructure but safe enough to enjoy right now.

It turns out that the more you like an activity, the safer you think it is. The more you dislike an activity, the more dangerous that you think that it is. To me, this explains the difference in opinion in how dangerous cycling is.

But this doesn't get us anywhere.

To paraphrase Wheatly from TEDx: "Public policy should not be based upon non-scientific opinion."

Thus, I feel that if we can't adequetely define risk, when we say that cycling is safe or dangerous we are only speaking of our own opinion.

The paper defines risk as; 

"Risk is generally taken to be the probability of injury, disease, or death under specific circumstances."

It goes on to say:

"The notion that there is some level of risk that everyone will find acceptable is a difficult idea to reconcile and yet, without such a baseline, how can it ever be possible to set guideline values and standards, given that life can never be risk-free?"

Here are WHO's risk levels:

1. Working risk:

1 in 1000 as the ‘just about tolerable risk’ for any substantial
category of workers for any large part of a working life.

2. Maximum Tolerable Risk:

1 in 10,000 as the ‘maximum tolerable risk’ for members of the public from any single non-nuclear plant. the cost of reducing the risk would exceed the costs saved

3. Nuclear Risk:

1 in 100,000 as the ‘maximum tolerable risk’ for members of the
public from any new nuclear power station.

4. Don't Care Risk

1 in 1,000,000 as the level of ‘acceptable risk’ at which no further
improvements in safety need to be made.

Obviously, we'd rather be at "don't care" level but this is not always possible.

WHO gives some other guidelines on when risk is deemed to be acceptable [I'm going to list just  few which apply to cycling]:

1. the cost of reducing the risk would exceed the costs saved

2, the opportunity costs would be better spent on other, more pressing, public health problems

Although people don't like it, we agree to #1 all the time. This is why we build freeways, why we leave our houses, and why we do not drive 20 MPH all the time. It would cost too much in money, time, and inconvenience.

But once we have agreed to make this trade-off, we need to be rational in where we are making it.

Thus, when we say that cycling is "risky" what does this mean?

The total cyclists deaths in 2009 was 630 [http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=total%20cyclists%20in%202009&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CCoQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov%2FPubs%2F811386.pdf&amp;ei=cCp7UOj1MIfc2QXU7ID4CQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHciXvHwJwVMSbXLWIlKQ6CcYvStw&amp;cad=rja]

The total bicycle commuters in 2009 is 766,000 [http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=total%20cyclists%20commuters%202009&amp;source=web&amp;cd=6&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CEAQFjAF&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fpolicy.rutgers.edu%2Ffaculty%2Fpucher%2FTRA960_01April2011.pdf&amp;ei=9Cp7UIi4LYS42gWRt4CwAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGKQDgT4Y0iYq6VsCSVXwxg9yoagA]

(Note that I picked 2009 because it was the most easiest to find of the most recent data.

Thus the risk rate is 1/1200 which makes cycling slightly safer than the total lifetime occupation risk, but less safe than the next level which is the maximal tolerable risk for the public at large which is 1/10,000.

Since cycling would have to become ten times safer to meet this standard, the highest number of fatalities is about 60 to 70 per year.

Again, one life lost is too many, but due to the above factors, we conclude that cycling is safe enough for those who are dedicated to cycling: it's comparable to any other reasonable occupation risk. On the other hand to expect the public at large to cycle, we should make cycling much safer.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Acceptable Risk NYC Style</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[NOTE: The numbers here don't totally match up on a yearly basis. This is a huge error that I regret, but my time is short. If someone wants to run the numbers with better data and share it, I'll buy you a beer.

Also, if someone can correct my math, I'd appreciate it. It could be totally wrong as I suck at math.

Begin Post:

If you only have a hammer everything looks like a nail.

If you learn about "acceptable risk" you want to run the numbers for every place that has juicy data!

LTRs know that I love NYC data because it's very complete compared to other areas.

Here I look at the total number of cyclists = 200,000 [http://www.bikesbelong.org/resources/stats-and-research/statistics/participation-statistics/]

There were an average of 23 deaths per year [http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/bicyclefatalities.pdf] thus, the risk of cycling is 15 per 100,000 which is within the maximum tolerated risk for the general population.

This is far safer than the US as a whole. Why the difference?

I don't know but I can guess that the reason is that streets in NYC tend to be slower. We know that speed kills.

In fact from the same study we see that over half the deaths were near arterials which as high speed streets. Getting cyclists off arterials seems to be the "single most effective way of saving lives". (Yes, I keep repeating this phrase because we keep seeing it associated with helmets which is total nonsense.)

However, when you take into about that ninety plus percent of the deaths were because cyclists were hit by a car, a different pattern emerges.

Cycling is now at the rate of 1/100,000 which is at the safety rate for new nuclear power stations which is ten times safer than the normal level of risk. This is risk level three which is super high. Thus, in New York without cars, cycling is super duper safe.

It seems that the secret sauce that kills cyclists is cars.

The above paper obsesses over where cyclists were hit, what they were doing, who was at fault, were they wearing a helmet. But here's the kicker: MOST CYCLISTS WERE HIT BY HIGH SPEED CARS. IF THOSE CARS WERE NOT THERE, THEN OVER 90% OF CYCLISTS IN NYC WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY.

Thus, for this case, it's highly inaccurate to say that cycling is dangerous as it meets and exceeds the maximum acceptable risk.

  <title>Rethinking Safety In Numbers</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/10/19/rethinking-safety-in-numbers/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Recent blog posts have pointed to research that suggests that the vast majority of cycling deaths were from fast  moving vehicles.

We could spend the rest of our lives, like the Cross study and the Orlando 2003 study, in order to assign blame and to find out what precisely happened in the majority of the cases.

But the more you look at the data, the more you see that the main pattern is that there are a lot of ways to get hit by cars and die. The single most factor that mattered is speed. If you get rid of speed, you get rid of serious injury and death.

This brings us to my second point, which is more of a speculation of the Bad Apples Hypothesis. Basically this says that there are a couple of shitty drivers out there who do the majority of the damage. I have not proven this, but I have read many stories where motorists repeatedly drive without a license and, until they hurt someone, nothing happens to them. Sometimes, even then nothing happens. Thus, it turns out that the whole magically "licensing" system doesn't really seem to work. This is especially true due to the fact that our "enforcement" system is broke in many ways including the sympathy that people get who are not allowed to drive because they are now stranded in their auto-centric housing that they CHOSE TO LIVE IN. This kind of sympathy is killing people.

All of this ties in with safety in numbers which I'll get to next. 

For those who are not LTRS, Safety in Numbers is the notion that the mere fact that more people cycle makes all cyclists safer.

For a long time, I was on the fence about this. I wanted it to be true because I like to believe that more cyclists magically makes us all safe. Maybe it does.

On the other hand it didn't make sense. The more cyclists on the road, the more likely one of them will collide which means it's more likely that they will die. Right?

Not unless the only real threat is high speed cars. 

Since there might be a limited number of Bad Apples, this means that if there are more people cycling, you aren't really safer because you can still get hit by a Bad Apple. On the other hand, since there are more cyclists out there the PERCENT FATALITIES goes down.

Perhaps this is why NYC has quadrupled their cycling numbers in the last few years, but fatalities are flat. This is because these people would have died no matter what due to being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Once we hit a plateau with the maximum number of us cyclists getting run down, there are no more Bad Apples out there.

Anyway, this is pretty confusing, and it might be wrong, but it's another way of looking at Safety In Numbers in a less mystical way. I'm sure that there is some truth to the standard assumption that cyclists are safer because many motorists learn to expect cyclists and drive accordingly. However, when there are still some Bad Apples out there, and we do nothing to stop them, there will be far more cycling fatalities than there should be.

And we have the soft on crime, revolving door system in place to protect our Bad Apples. 

And no politician from the Left nor from the Right has ever had the courage to stand up and get the Bad Apples off the road.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>High Speeds Are the Green Eggs and Ham of Cycling Fatalities</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Before I write my own post, here's a brilliant insight into <a href="http://losangelespublicspace.blogspot.com/2012/09/responding-to-slates-why-you-hate.html">motoring psychology.</a> Too often the notion is that motorists are monsters or somehow insane. I do not think that this is a useful way to more forward. Rather, I think that motorists are normal humans who are doing the best they can in a really badly built environment. A bad place makes for a bad set of choices and it either expects people to be Buddha or to be human. People, like me, usually choose to be human.

Here's a quote: "Implicit in the expectation of efficient travel is an expectation amongst many that automobiles are the only vehicles with the right of way on the streets, leaving little room for any other modes of transportation.  The resulting tensions between bicyclists and drivers are problems of environmental design and culture, not one of bad decision-making either by bicyclists and/or drivers."

Nothing new here--when is there ever :) --but I thought about this when riding to work this morning. High speeds are like green eggs and ham to cycling deaths.

The other part of the analogy is every other thing that is blamed for killing cyclists.

"So what killed the cyclist?

Was it her earphones? Her dark colored clothes? Her lack of proper cycling education?

No, it was a high speed car.

Did she die with a helmet, without a helmet, on the sidewalk, on the road? 

No, it was a high speed car.

Was it the cyclist's fault, motorist's fault, road designers fault, by standers fault?

No, it was a high speed car.

Was the cyclist taking the lane, hit by a door, going the right way or the wrong way?

No, it was a high speed car."

That's right, it doesn't matter what the cyclist is doing, where she is, how smart or stupid she is nor the weather nor the time of day.

The single biggest variable in cyclists deaths is high speed cars. 

That's it.

It's so simple that I feel stupid for saying it.

But look at the "safety literature" and there's tons of nonsensical variables that are very carefully analyzed.

I feel like a fool for many of my prior posts with my "data analysis" because it's all a waste of time.

But I guess I had to go through this to get to where I am today.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Top Down Vs. Bottom Up</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/10/24/top-down-vs-bottom-up/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I used to be a bottom upper, I really was.

To backtrack for those who are not in the know, there is a debate on how to solve environmental problems. Somehow this has infected the cycling world as well.

The first approach is the Top Down which means that the government solves the problem by fiat. For example, when they discovered that cholera was killing lots of people, they created sanitation standards and we have no more cholera. Or when they decided that we should all have electricity and they build power grids and now we have electricity in our houses.

This is becoming more and more unpopular because unlike cholera, many people don't see our problems as real. There are many reasons for that, but mainly people think that the government sucks at doing stuff.

This brings in the super-popular, Bottom Up approach which means that everyone does their best on their own. 

This works well for some things. For example, the sleeping problem is best solved by this problem. We don't have the government coming into our houses and tying us to our beds for eight hours. 

(At least most of us don't get this service, but it's hard to be sure knowing some of my LTRs). :)

On the other hand, when it comes to cycling safety, I think that the bottom up approach sucks.

I first had an inkling that this was stupid when I read about an environmentalist talk about how if we all do a little bit, we'll only get a little way to solving the problem.

This is also true of cycling safety.

I have noticed that the things that people really carry about we have a top down approach. It does not matter if you are a conservative or a liberal, the government is the answer to your problems in these cases.

For example, if you need a road, we don't all go out there with pick axes and shovels, we get tax dollars and contract it out.

I feel that the same solution should apply to cycling.

I have also noticed that there is a pattern with the bottom up solutions which all suck.

Here are some shitty bottom up solutions that don't work:

1. Wear a helmet

2. Education 

3. Public awareness (yet another form of education where we hope that motorists are more aware)

4. Wearing bright colors

See why these are so popular? They don't really ask anyone to _do_ anything. They cost only a little amount of money.

And best of all, they force a cyclist to bear 100% of the responsibility of her safety even though I have all ready proven that by riding a bicycle, she has all ready made the safer choice.

Now we're going to penalize her for that by making do a bunch of other stuff that doesn't work?

Does anyone really wonder why cycling is more unpopular than drugs?]]></content:encoded>

I love it: Shattered Myths! Kind of like the Rolling Stones song. :)

First of all, I'm not going to answer any of the points made on the above page.

But I will say this. Helmets ought not to be encouraged by cycling commuting because they are a HUGE waste of money. If half the cyclists who ride their bikes once or more a year spent their "helmet money" on infrastructure in one year we'd have Portland in all of our major cities. In fact, he actually conceeded that if we had better infrastructure then we would have less injuries than we do now with helmets.

Well, I have been asked to do it, and now I will, I'm going after serious injuries that were prevented by helmets.

First let's talk claims.

You can quote me on this. If Mitt Romney wins the election, and he wants to get his scissors out, he can start by cutting the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Not to digress, but they are a number of reasons that this is a piece of shit organization and being useless is not the only one. They are also a sleeper protectionist organization masquerading (and doing a shit job) as a safety agency. See wikipedia for details.

However, they did me a favor by putting out a juicy and crazy "Traffic Safety Facts" page:

http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=8&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CFoQFjAH&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.accidentreconstruction.com%2Fnewsletter%2Ffeb06%2FBikeHelmetUse.pdf&amp;ei=cluDUOjAN-aC2AWgj4DwBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEo9o5_RQ5plnOLWuqB8udggjwzmg&amp;sig2=HBqxb8prVOQ2OY1MMDINCQ

"The estimated annual cost of bicycle‐related injuries and deaths (for all ages) is $8 billion."
First of all, note the use of the word "estimated". See Mitch Hedberg for details on how they "estimate" things. :)
ey
This would be significant cost savings!

Imagine a magical alternative place, similar to the US, where they actually did have a helmet law. You'd expect the health care spending to go down, after such a law, or at least remain stable. Yes.

LTRs know that there is such a place: Australia.

Here's a grapn of their health care costs:

http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCwQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.commonwealthfund.org%2F~%2Fmedia%2FFiles%2FPublications%2FIssue%2520Brief%2F2012%2FMay%2F1595_Squires_explaining_high_hlt_care_spending_intl_brief.pdf&amp;ei=qV-DUJ-GO6ec2AXhuoDoCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFS1hX1fropqhocBG8bEa-CRkFxpw&amp;sig2=cZ9uQ8EDczpdaaAKhy-3Ow

Please look on page two at either graph. Note the lines for Australia. Do you see the big dip on the left graph? Haha, that's NOT Australia and it's not during the 90's but it is the kind of dip that I'd expect if we had a few billion dollars cost savings in health car. I would not expect the spending to go up but that's exactly what it did. 

Why no change?

Because helmets don't save any significant amount of money in health care costs.

This leads us to this excellent analysis of the effects of helmets on injury rates:

http://pjakma.wordpress.com/2011/06/23/study-shows-australian-cyclist-helmet-law-leads-to-increasing-head-injury-rates/

"A careful look at the study  shows there appears to be a significant benefit only over a short-period of time, across the few months where the [mandatory helmet] law is passed. While beyond that the helmet law has managed to turn a decreasing head injury rate into an increasing head injury rate (fig 3)...So what is happening?"

The study mentions regression to the mean without being explicit:

"Another possibility is that injury rates just happened co-incidentally to be at a high prior to the law, and that the law has had little causal effect."

I agree that this has to be a big factor. It almost always is when you have data that tend to be consistent overall but will fluctuate over time.

Conclusion:

"That means, so far as the study is accurate, that beyond a short-period, the study actually shows an apparent detrimental impact on safety in terms of head injury rates,"

While "correlation does not always indicate causation" sometimes it does.

Also, before you get causation you do need to have correlation. Since we don't have it, it's safe to say that helmets are useless, overall, for preventing injuries and for reducing health care costs.

Hopefully, Mitt will cut this bullshit organization that wastes our money putting out nonsense reports and "safety facts".]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Cycle Fop</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The cycling world is full of controversies for some reason. It seems that even the simplest ideas get tons of opinions and debate.

One of them is the notion of clothing. 

I love this debate because when you search and replace the arguments with "car" hilarity ensues:

"What clothing should I buy for driving my car?"

"If I wear a suit in my car then other people are going to think that since they don't look nice in a suit then they are going to be stuck taking the bus."

Yes, these are the things we love to argue about. And since I love gossip and argument, I am in my element. :)

I first got involved in cycling foppery in the late nineties when I was obsessed with the writings of William Burroughs.

He always looked stylish in a suit, and thus, I tried to emulate this look, but in a lesser manner by wearing a pressed white shirt and dress slacks everywhere. I thought nothing of wearing this while I rode my bicycle.

Little did I know that a few years later there would be a whole movement known as <a href="http://www.copenhagencyclechic.com/">Cycle Chic.</a>

Nor did I realize that on the other end of the spectrum there would be those who thought that you had to wear lycra racing gear with sponsor logos all over it even if those companies weren't even sponsoring you.

But while I did touring, I did wear some excellent bicycle pants which were relatively warm, but still comfortable on warmer days and best of all, super fast drying. 

For a full year after I moved to San Diego, I wore the same pants nearly every day.

Only on special occasions did I wear nicer clothes for which I got tons of compliments. Most of all, I realized that it made my princess happy to be seen with a man who didn't dress like a complete bum.

But what really made me change my mind was my mid-life crisis (mlc) and this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icevac7jdig">conversation</a> between Patrice O' Neal and Gallager. 

Note that I find everyone on the show to be offensive except for Patrice who is really awesome--the only comic I'd really like to hang out with if he hadn't died.

So you don't have to listen to all 14 parts of the interview, but just trust that Patrice inspired me when he started talking about how Gallager needed to raise his game and to dress better since he was older.

Since I am Patrice's age, I realized that I, too, need to stop wearing goofy clothes, to stop dressing like a bum, and to start dressing like an adult.

Thus, I am in a clothing renaissance, but since Cycle Chic is all ready taken, I'm rollin with Cycle Fop.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Mindfulness Cycling 8/14</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[First I'd like to start with this quote:

"… If we understood the power of our thoughts, we would guard them more closely.  If we understood the awesome power of our words, we would prefer silence to almost anything negative."

This comes from <a href="http://cultfit.wordpress.com/2012/10/24/you-dont-make-me-sorry/">Cult Fit.</a> Thanks Cult!

http://deerparkmonastery.org/mindfulness-practice/the-fourteen-mindfulness-trainings

I am really enjoying this series because writing it forces me to re-read the mindfulness trainings over and over again which is really helpful especially when I have some personal difficulty.

I do realize that this is all in my head as I someone in my position has always had a position of privilege which protected me against real problems.

This week we talk about:

The Eighth Mindfulness Training: True Community and Communication

"Aware that lack of communication always brings separation and suffering, we are committed to training ourselves in the practice of compassionate listening and loving speech."

I can think of three places where communication matters, which is between cyclists and motorists on the road, between motorists and cyclists off the road, and between cyclists as a community.

I have found that the best on road communication is found in the front wheel of a car: if they are moving, I yield. 

Second best is my hands: I point to where I want to go as well as waving cars past me as I yield to them.

Off road, motorists seem to want to vent to cyclists a great deal. Though their anger is totally out of proportion to what cyclists normally do, I feel that it is my role to listen.

This is very depressing and also draining so overall, I tend to conceal the fact that I like to ride a bicycle, and to not talk about cycling too much. It's kind of a pity that it has to be this way, but you see the looks of contempt on people's faces, even those who think of themselves as "nice people."

Plus they say patronizing and ignorant things which totally ignore the fact that cycling is super-awesome for many, many reasons.

Thus, it's best to not talk about it, too much. However, I must say, that in the past few weeks, I have gotten very much positive feedback when I let it slip that I ride a bicycle for more than play.

Finally, however, there's the cycling community which is a hot mess.

We are at each other's throats over "taking the lane" versus building infrastructure. We fight over clothing styles...Really? Really? How far from high school and it's still about clothes. :)

We argue over which type of bicycle to wear and if flip-flops are "appropriate" footwear for cycling. (I think yes).

Oh, and helmets. Yeah! Let's argue over useless headgear instead of enjoying the wind in our hair (or on our bald heads).

We can fight over all kinds of stupid stuff, but this is probably a waste of time. I am all into deep listening, but overall, I keep hearing the same stuff over and over again, and this is frustrating.

"Knowing that true community is rooted in inclusiveness and in the concrete practice of the harmony of views, thinking and speech, we will practice to share our understanding and experiences with members in our community in order to arrive at a collective insight."

I am happy that there are inclusive communities out there, but the cycling community, for some reason, seems to divide itself into smaller and smaller groups.

So at this point, outside this blog, I try to listen more than I talk, and I don't have much to share unless people have questions. Overall, I just don't like talking about cycling, too much if we aren't getting to the next level.

"Whenever difficulties arise, we will remain in our Sangha and practice looking deeply into ourselves and others to recognize all the causes and conditions, including our own habit energies, that have brought about the difficulties."

This part, I totally agree with. Almost 100% of my problems are caused by me, but it's nice to see a reminder on this.

"We will not behave as a victim but be active in finding ways to reconcile and resolve all conflicts however small."

This is a great way to end it. Too often, in my internal monologue, I do think of myself as a victim. It's nice to see that there is an alternative.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>What is Victim Psychology?</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/10/29/what-is-victim-psychology/</link>
  <pubDate>Mon, 29 Oct 2012 18:49:48 +0000</pubDate>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, I have been obsessed with getting to the bottom of one of the most unsettling anti-infrastructure appeals.

I can see now that it seems like <a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-victim-psychology.htm">Victim Psychology</a> might have something to say about this.

What I am talking about specifically is when I talk about cycling infrastructure to those I would think would find it most appealing, and they still don't get it.

I would have thought that the notion that our environment affects our decisions would be obvious.

Obviously, one sleeps better when one has a nice comfortable bed rather than when trying to sleep on a smelly bed of nails. This idea is pretty obvious to me.

Not to those who are "victims" it seems.

Instead of making our built environment safer and more sane, they are obsessed with pinning the blame on someone.

The cannonical paper, for me, on this is the infamous Orlando 2003 "safety" study where every other word was VIOLATION. In every collision, there was someone to blame.

Well, duh. In every collision someone did something they shouldn't have done namely crashed their car into a bicycle at high speed. It's not rocket science to say that this is a VIOLATION.

Suggesting that they should have paid attention more or whatever is besides the point. Someone should not get the death penalty nor have to live with the blood of someone on their hands if they mess up a little. That's disproportional.

It also made zero sense to me until I read the following (from the above paper):

"The term generally refers not to a person who is the victim of a terrible act, such as a natural disaster, but rather to someone who avoids personal responsibility or bad feelings by blaming others. Many therapists and mental health professionals see victim psychology as a destructive mechanism that can inhibit personal relationships and a happy life."

Yes! These people are ALWAYS angry.

"A person displaying victim psychology may be obsessed with fairness or morality. Generally, he or she believes that good things that occur are deserved, and bad things that occur are because someone else is being cruel, thoughtless, or unfair."

Yes, I always hear cries of more punishment and "education" whenever there are "victims" around.

There's the notion of punishing drivers and killing cyclists who mess up.

I guess I don't buy into this because I don't feel that the world is fair.

However, it can be safer.

Here's some <a href="http://www.sustainablesafety.nl/index_uk.htm">sweet sustainable safety:</a>

"What causes crashes? In the original version of Sustainable Safety, the starting point was that crashes were in the end caused by predominantly unintentional errors by road users. Since it is quite often stated that hard-core or repeat offenders cause crashes, we have tried to investigate the distribution of crash causes. 

This has led to the view that it is quite often difficult to attribute crash causes to actions that are either ‘unintentional errors’ or ‘deliberate violations’."

Yes!

But do the victims hear us?

"Like a deer in the headlights, victim psychology can paralyze a person and prevent him or her from making logical decisions. Being so caught up in how unfair a situation is, a person may be unable to think of ways or actions that could solve the problem. Instead of determining how to fix an issue, arguments or problems can quickly dissolve into accusations of blame, which is generally helpful to no one."

I suggest that we prevent crashes through modest changes in our existing infrastructure budget. 

Sustainable safety is the breath of fresh air that we are sorely lacking.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Bicycle As a Brand</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[LTRs probably know by now that branding and advertising are one of my biggest passions right now.

Last weekend, I realized that cycling itself was a brand. 

Not a particular type of bicycle like a Surly or Canon, but rather the _idea_ of riding a bicycle to work is a brand.

As a brand, we are doing really, really badly.

Even the risk takers, like motorcyclists see cyclists as shy and weak.

This is crazy because they love motorcycles because of the danger. Then they say that they don't want to ride a bicycle because it is too dangerous!

Those in the know, realize that branding makes no sense so this isn't the end of the world.

People's minds are flexible and subject to change.

First of all, I am not going into the motorcycle space to compete. I learned that this won't work at all, which is totally fine with me.

Instead, I have decided to personally decide what a bicycle means to me and what makes it appealing to me.

So what do I see when I see a bicycle?

I see a pile of money, a great body, and a beautiful sunny day spent outside.

The pile of money is all the money I save in not driving.

The great body is obviously the fact that every second that others are sitting in traffic getting angry, I'm working out.

Finally, each time I ride my bicycle to work, instead of a morning commute that people like the band MGMT bitch about:

"We'll get jobs in offices and wake up for the morning commute"

I look forward to my commute!

So this is what I tell people when they talk about my bicycle: pile of money, great body, and a smile. :)]]></content:encoded>

I really love the notion of selling it as sex--it's a great way to meet people especially at cycling events.

One of my comebacks for a group ride, when appropriate, when asked "why are you riding", as if we need a reason, is "to get the chics." :)]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Mindfulness Cycling 9/14</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[OK, let's get back on track!

http://deerparkmonastery.org/mindfulness-practice/the-fourteen-mindfulness-trainings

The Ninth Mindfulness Training: Truthful and Loving Speech

Ug, outside of the drugs and alcohol section, this is one of the toughest ones for me.

"We will use only words that inspire joy, confidence and hope as well as promote reconciliation and peace in ourselves and among other people."

I love this because there is so much animosity in the bicycling world today both between cyclists and motorists and between different cycling groups.

I really like this post where Ted tried to reach out to all the differing communities:

http://bikinginla.wordpress.com/2012/10/01/the-terrible-tyranny-of-two-wheel-tribal-wear/

The next line, I like even better:

"As members of a spiritual community, we should nonetheless take a clear stand against oppression and injustice."

Yes!!

Too many people in the Buddhist community like to think that they are excempt from dealing with the problems of the world. Through my own meditation, I have found that the opposite is the case for me. That is, the calmer I got the more I could deal with people in a sane manner especially when they were doing things that are wrong.

The cycling community has been perfect plastic Buddhas when it comes to the problems in the world, but what we need are real live humans with human emotions.

While it's true that being very placid can be a way to "survive our hostile environment", we'd be stupid and selfish if we didn't try to make that world a bit less hostile.

"We should strive to change the situation, without taking sides in a conflict."

This, I flat out disagree with.

No!! We must take our own side because nobody else would. We have stood by for decades trying to be "fair".

No more.

When one doesn't have anything, one can not be generous. When one does not have equal power, one can not be fair.

"We are committed to learning to look with the eyes of interbeing and to see ourselves and others as cells in one Sangha body. As a true cell in the Sangha body, generating mindfulness, concentration and insight to nourish ourselves and the whole community, each of us is at the same time a cell in the Buddha body."

Yes!!

But our cells need fresh air!

Also, I feel that if Buddhists really looked with interbeing which means that they look at the whole world as a whole instead of as individuals, public meditation places would be car free.

I do like the idea that all my actions affect the whole world and that I should treat others like I want to be treated. But this cuts both ways. i can write more on good meditation spots later. It's NOT true that one can meditate anywhere or at any phase of one's life.

"We will actively build brotherhood and sisterhood, flow as a river, and practice to develop the three real powers – understanding, love and cutting through afflictions – to realize collective awakening."

Yes, but to cut through afflictions, at this point, cyclists need to be much more aggressive.

I challenge any really advanced spiritual being to come on my commute. Only on the seat of a bicycle, I feel can one fully demonstrate to me one's attainments.

It's really easy to act all Zen when one is driven around in air-conditioned luxury.

I realize that this is probably way harsher than it needs to be, but there's bile everywhere, I guess, and it needs to get out. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Wasteful Government Programs: DMV</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/11/07/wasteful-government-programs-dmv/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Here's an idea. Let's get rid of wasteful government programs so that it can free up some money for cycling.

1. Get rid of the DMV.

Yes, that's right, let's get rid of silly driver's licenses and license plates.

But people will go crazy out there.

"The DMV is responsible for registering vehicles and for promoting public safety on California’s streets and highways by issuing driver licenses."

http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CCkQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lao.ca.gov%2Fanalysis%2F2012%2Ftransportation%2Fdmv-efficiencies-022412.pdf&amp;ei=OA-UUMSxFon3iwKN54GQAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHDI7OtpG9oa5XQ2b7wX_loF7ZCrg&amp;sig2=06K8Hi3jYGdCM9Fhcd-Qlw

Nonsense.

Get outside and ride a bike in a dangerous area of LA or San Diego. 

Guess what? It's a nightmare all ready.

As I learned slowing traffic down makes us safer. That's it.

Pieces of plastic in one's wallet and aluminum rectanges on one's car do NOT make us safer.

It's a total waste of money.

Here's why. When was the last time you got harassed by a motorist and you get the "plate number" and called it in?

If your life is like mine, hilarity ensued.

IF THE OFFICER DIDN'T SEE IT, HE WON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

Even if you have it on camera, what are you going to do? March up to the mayor's office with an envelope and a tape of corruption?

It's silly.

Also, as for driver's licenses, police don't site you for it until you do something wrong like kill someone. By then, the cat's out of the bag.

After that, what next? You can drive again. Who will know?

This happens all the time and the notion of licenses does NOT make us safer so let's get rid of them.

If we do that we get almost a billion dollars a year!

"The Governor’s budget proposes total expenditures of $967 million (including capital outlay expenditures) to support DMV in 2012-13..."

This is PER YEAR!

I suggest we stop wasting time on things that clearly do not work and start doing things that work.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Motoring As a Belief System</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/11/05/motoring-as-a-belief-system/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Often there are things in our lives which are actually beliefs, but we take them to be "realistic".

The motoring transportation system is one of them.

There are many, many beliefs which are associated with motoring. In this post, I'll talk about a very small number of them.

The Fight Club Rule: That is, the first thing about motoring is that we don't talk about it as motoring. It's just normal. Thus, to even speak or write about motoring as a belief system will get most people thinking that I hate cars or that I'm some kind of radical with an "agenda".

If it's radical to try to understand and to write about our world as it is, then, yes, I'm radical.

Motoring is a huge, huge, huge part of our world. If you just assume that the car is relegated to a plaything of the rich, which it was initially, the world looks vastly, vastly different as to be unrecognizable.

Just think about not having a car. Don't think about living out in the middle of nowhere, like you do now, with no way of getting anywhere. Imagine that anywhere is right outside so you can walk to it.

Imagine the quiet, the lack of pollution, the open spaces which are preserved. Imagine all the sons who are alive today because we weren't controlling the Middle East for oil.

Imagine that suburbanization never happened to the extent that it did so you can ride your bicycle to the country in under an hour.

Imagine not having to freak out every time a child goes near the road because there's no danger. Imagine no stop signs and no stop lights as these are made by motorists to mitigate some of the danger of other motorists to themselves.

Oops, I didn't mean to veer off in this direction, I wanted to talk about what is real rather than some counter-factual historical writing, although the latter is kind of awesome.

I'll stop here because I know it sounds like Utopia, but it's not somehow.

No, things are way better now...

I only wrote about one belief, but there are many more to talk about in future posts...

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Motoring Beliefs: Responsibility

One of the biggest obsessions in the motoring world is responsibility for risk.

This is the elephant in the room when it comes to cycling and it's why people say stupid things like "cyclists take their lives in their hands."

This is due to the pervasive obsession with the notion that one and only one person must be responsible for collisions.

The first thing that's funny is that collisions are commonly called accidents which by definition are nobody's fault. I must be the only person in the world who thinks it's funny how oxymoronic the statement "whos' fault is an accident" is.

Here's the thing. If we have a system where a single lapse of concentration can kill or maim a stranger or ourselves then we obsess over who messed up.

How about the asshole who designed such an error prone and deadly system?

If I force you to concentrate for an hour and if you lose attention at any time, I shoot you in the face, is it your fault for not paying attention?

Thus, for me the whole idea of fluorescent clothing, helmets, blinking lights, and safety classes is silly when someone with poor vision and even worse credit can run me down in an eye blink.

The fact is that EVERYONE loses attention sometime or another. If there's a smaller vehicle or a bicycle that we don't see then they are dead. Or we are if we run our tiny SUV into a massive train. Thus, ANYONE can possibly kill anyone else due to a small mistake. Thus, it's really silly to start finger wagging to those who are unlucky enough to hurt someone with their car.

Let's stop the pointless blame game and stop making situations where people do things that they get blamed for.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Motoring Beliefs: Costs and Benefits</title>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Continuing this sure to be annoying topic, I turn my attention to the another set of beliefs which underlies Why Things The Way They Are right now.

1. Motor vehicle access, only, is mandatory. This means that if you can't drive a car to it, you can't get there.

While this is not actually true, this is a belief which underlies a standard for construction.

That's why no matter how beautiful an area is, a beach or mountain, you see a bunch of cars littering the landscape. There's never a place that's popular which doesn't demand an unsightly mass of asphalt to mar the otherwise picturesque location.

Imagine if you gave mountain biking, only access, to an area. How nice would that be? Or boating only?

I suspect that this belief is related to the other belief:

2. Fires can be fought only with massive petrol powered vehicles. 

Whenever you hear about "fire access" what they really mean is that they are going to pave over a huge enough area for a massive vehicle to get somewhere in case there's a fire.

Again, I have nothing by gratitude and appreciation for the brave women and men who fight fires. However, I know that since they are strong enough to face deadly fires, they can withstand a few tough questions.

Here it is: can we fight fires without huge vehicles? I'm guessing that the geniuses who created all the stuff that creates fires in the first place can somehow figure out a way to extinguish one in a bike only area.

3. All other forms of transportation must serve the interests of motorists.

This is tricky territory because there are often studies that come out that talk about how cycling helps the local economy or reduces congestion. My take on this is who cares?

When did the AAA think about how to spend a few billion to make my life more comfortable and my ride more efficient?

Thus, we must think about promises made because they create a wrong frame.

Cycling infrastructure is created for those who want to ride a BICYCLE, only. NOT for existing cyclists who clearly don't need it. NOT for motorists who want their roads less congested. NOT for selfish local business owners who don't want to give up motoring parking.

Think about it. When we build a freeway, we don't think about how it's going to help the subway riders by reducing the crowds taking the train. We don't widen and speed up local roads to make cycling more pleasant.

So why should bike lanes help with congestion or economics?

Doesn't make sense.

There are many more assumptions, I think, that I can tackle in later posts in this series. When I started, I didn't realize how captive my own mind was towards the pro-motoring belief system.

Again, I'm not trying to be anti-motoring here, but I am trying to clear my mind of the coercive propaganda that has been force fed to me my whole life.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Infrastructure Economics Basics</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/11/09/infrastructure-economics-basics/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[LTRs know all this and may skip. This is pretty simple stuff, but I run into it over and over again so I'll summarize here.

There's a basic principle of economics called <a href="http://depts.alverno.edu/dgp/GEC/Principles%20of%20Economics.html">Tradeoffs:</a>

"Scarcity of economic resources forces people to make tradeoffs. That is, people must always consider how to spend their own limited incomes or time because resources are limited to satisfy their unlimited needs and wants. Tradeoffs or choosing a one thing means giving up something else. When we give up an item, we lose the benefits of its services to us or incur costs to obtain the benefits of the thing we decided to choose. Thus, making decisions requires comparing the costs and benefits of alternative courses of action."

Althought this is super-duper obvious, we often act, while dealing with cycling as transporation as this were not true.

A notable example is the texting while driving ban. This law has not been shown to reduce accidents, but we are continuing to pursue it. A similar argument can be made with helmets.

That's why it's total nonsense to say "every little bit helps."

No! Every little bit spent on you useless pet project times the population at large is a lot of wasted money that does not help.

Another notion which is totally ignored at times is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility">The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility:</a>

"Economists sometimes speak of a law of diminishing marginal utility, meaning that the first unit of consumption of a good or service yields more utility than the second and subsequent units.[citation needed] The marginal decision rule states that a good or service should be consumed at a quantity at which the marginal utility is equal to the marginal cost"

This comes up in road projects a lot. People keep wanting to expand roads, which costs a ton of money, instead of building cycling infrastructure which comparatively costs little.

Comparing cycling infrastructure to road infrastructure is comparing apples to oranges because the roads are done, they go everywhere, while there's no safe insfrastructure that connnects anything meaningful in San Diego to anything else.

So there's a much larger payoff from building something for cycling rather than for motoring.

Finally, there's a medical term known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triage">Triage</a>:

"Triage (play /ˈtriːɑːʒ/ (UK English) or /triːˈɑːʒ/ (US English)) is the process of determining the priority of patients' treatments based on the severity of their condition. This rations patient treatment efficiently when resources are insufficient for all to be treated immediately."

This means that we must deal with the most dangerous situations first. That is, to fix the deadliest areas first. 

In the past, the design of infrastructure in San Diego for cycling almost operated in an opposite manner. This is because projects are built based upon "community input" which means that the most dangerous areas such as University Avenue are not fixed while we continue to build excellent cycle tracks next to the harbor and beaches where virtual nobody commutes.

With our new mayor, I hope that we toss out our emotional and consensus based models and instead move toward building infrastructure based upon sound economic and medical principles.

  <title>Advocacy Mindset: It's Global!</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/11/11/advocacy-mindset-its-global/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[LTRs have probably figured out my formula for blog posts: read something totally unrelated to cycling and find a link to the two wheeled beast, no matter how tenuous.

Well, here I go again.

I have been reading a book called _Put Your Mindset to Work_ [http://www.amazon.com/Put-Your-Mindset-Work-Really/dp/B006CDDOZM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1352651314&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=put+your+mindset+to+work].

It's mostly fluff with Shit I All Ready Know.

However, I feel that it's good to reinforce good ideas so I'm doing just that.

On the other hand, many advocates I have spoken to do NOT have a 3G mindset so perhaps these ideas are needed more than I know. AlsHavo, it just might explain why despite decades of cycling advocacy, modeshare has remained flat.

Let's find out.

In the book, they have a 3G attitude for success: global, good, and grit.

Here we'll talk about a global mindset.

Having a global mindset means seeking the new and different. Instead of asking, if it's in AASHTO, the global mindset would ask, what is best practice in the world.

Instead of having the attitude of NIH, not invented here, globally minded advocates will try to get what works well in other countries here. These advocates will explore new ideas with openness and curiosity. They won't ask what is in the vehicle code nor what people will accept nor whether we can afford it nor what is politically possible. The close minded mindset only seek to crush brilliant new innovations in the cradle and they create an atmosphere of fear. The greatest thrill of the close minded is finding tiny flaws in ideas before they are even fully formed. The close minded feel that any changes will be permanent rather than realizing that our cities are forever blank canvases for the most imaginative to paint upon.

And by paint, I don't mean this metaphorically. After all, if paint on the road will do nothing to improve safety why would lane positioning, lights and a yellow vest have any effect. :)

Another attitude of the globally minded is connection. By connection, they don't merely sign up to social networks and go to networking events, but they contribute. Many of us have fear of getting contacted by people because we know that they want something from us.

Instead, we need to get out there and to find out what other people want and to make an effort to make it happen.

Another global attitude is looking at the big picture, a literal global view. How often do we hear nonsense about more local control for things like transportation issues. Sure, let's create a system that is guaranteed to create a disconnected mess of a bicycling system.

Instead of just trying to get things working in our own neighborhood, we need to see how this interacts with the plans of other neighborhoods.

The book _Reluctant Metropolis_ shows the idiocy of trying to focus on one's own backyard, only. They have wound up looking even more homogenous than if they had looked at the bigger picture with abandoned shells of identical chain businesses only a few miles away which have taken from their communities then left behind more problems than if they had developed nothing at all.

Bike lanes that only go for a few miles do nothing to increase connectivity thus we should plan to connect neighborhoods at a more city wide and even at a nation wide level given some sweet interstate cycle paths.

While these things take time, instead of just thinking about how long things should take if we act, we also need to point out what would happen if we don't act.

If you see cycling infrastructure as optional then it's OK to wait decades and centuries to build it. After all, we don't want to offend anyone with some paint. :)

On the other hand, if we realize the consequences if we don't act then perhaps we'd be more motivated.

Finally, those who are close minded are often convergent thinkers. That is they are focused on getting things right. This is legal, this is not. This is AASHTO, this is not. And so on.

These thinkers get frustrated with people who aren't so concerned with their limited world view known as the "facts" and this explains why they are uncomfortable when they meet with people who don't fit into their mold.

Divergent thinkers, on the other hand are more focused on creativity.

A question they often ask is if there were no constraints, how would be solve this problem?" 

Often the answers to these questions are possible and much more beneficial than the limited views we had before.

Based on what I have learned I feel that we should stop using fear of being wrong to keep our views focused on the immediate limitations such as laws, politics, and public opinion.

Also, we should stop thinking of our own limited desires (right to the road) and instead think of the long term impacts on our decisions.

Finally, we should stop using this idiotic "local" mantra and instead focus on how improvements in our community can benefit the city, country, and even world as a whole.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Advocacy Mindset: It's Good!</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/11/12/advocacy-mindset-its-good/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Continuing in our application of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Put-Your-Mindset-Work-Really/dp/B006CDDOZM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1352651314&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=put+your+mindset+to+work">_Mindset_</a>, next I cover the second G, which is Good.

How do you know an advocate is Good?

First, I'll talk about what it means to not be good.

Many advocates I have met have been not too good.

That is, they have not listened to me at all. In fact, they made me feel like an idiot for having any ideas at all. They have often said one thing to one group of people and the opposite to another. The fact that our streets in San Diego suck for cycling is as much the fault of those who pretend to speak for me, but do not, as it is because of malignant neglect from those who have designed our streets to be so deadly.

For me, a key phrase of a not very good advocate is where they talk about education too much. The reason that this is suspect is because this means that they have a fixed mindset that is closed to listening to other people. Teachers talk a great deal and feel that they have little to learn from their students.

So what does it mean to be good?

First of all, a good advocate is honest. If she's anti-infrastructure, she won't present herself as anything else even if she knows that people won't like her.

Thus, someone who is truly honest, who is good, might be less liked than someone who says what they know is socially acceptable. Good advocates are also not liked because they open their mouths when it's not politically savvy to do so. That's the point of being an advocate, being a pain in the ass. An advocate who's liked by all is probably totally ineffective.

Another point of a good advocate is that they are balanced. This means realizing that they are not going to get everything that they want perfectly. I'd rather take some imperfect infrastructure than none at all. An advocate who is unbalanced believes that they are perfect and the expect others to be perfect at all times. This sounds silly and insane, but think about the Orlando 2003 paper which blamed each cyclist's death on a tiny mistake that they had made. If only they were super-human, they'd be alive today.

Another aspect of being good is openness. A good organization has clear goals and will admit when they do not meet these goals. It's OK to try hard and not meet all of our goals after a single try. If an organization has no goals or their goals are so vague as to be meaningless this is because they either are working against what they know that the public wants or they are too lazy to do anything meaningful. I suggest against giving your money and time to such organizations. 

Finally, a good advocate is fair. They believe that the punishment should fit the crime. Too often, those opposed to decent infrastructure instead suggest that a minor mistake or traffic violation deserves the death penalty. Nobody should die for making a small mistake on their bicycle. Yet this is the world that the humans with power have constructed for those of us who enjoy cycling.

Knowing what makes an advocate good does not mean that I feel that any advocate is perfect. We can all do better. However, we should have some standards for our behavior in order to improve ourselves, and I do believe that the traits above are a good start.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Advocacy Mindset: True Grit!</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[To me, grit is one of the most important traits of them all.

However, I like to distinguish between two kinds of grit or tenacity which is stupid tenacity and smart tenacity.

If you do something and you do not get the result that you expected, it's commendable to keep trying.

However, after a point, you have three choices, and two of them are bad. One is to keep doing the same thing year after year without really tracking your progress.

These people have stupid grit. They use phrases like "these things take decades" and "I've been doing this for years".

To quote the Clash, "If you've been trying for years, we 'ready heard your song." 

On the other hand, those who try a limited number of times and then just give up are also equally wrong. They say phrases such as "this is a motoring country".

The third, and correct approach is to see what went wrong, to really one's approach and the situation then to try again.

Our friend, the book _Mindset_ has some further insight into grit.

First, they talk about growth which means that one seeks to better oneself. The biggest attitude, in the cycling world, which is anti-growth is the notion of experts. An expert is all ready done, has no where to go, and will no longer grow. Thus, is the Zen cliche, "beginner's mind" where we seek to always see things in a fresh way. We also always realize that we can learn more. This is super important and can't be emphasized enough because once we freeze into an expert mode, we stop learning and keeping up with modern discoveries.
 
Another trait is resilience. This means that we continue to act in a skillful manner even when things do not go our way. 

Next is intensity which is focus on the task at hand. One way to tell how well an organization is doing is how focused they are on their core mission. If it can't be summarized in a few words then the organization is probably all over the place. For example, one disorganized organization claimed that they wanted to make "cycling better". A more effective organization would focus on one thing such as infrastructure.

Finally, tenacity, like I spoke of before, is paramount. You know someone lacks grit whenever they speak in terms of being uncomfortable. Gritty people focus on their mission no matter how difficult things are. 

Comfort is for losers!

  <title>How I Stopped Worrying And Learned To Love the 85th Percentile</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Many alterative transportation advocates are against the 85th percentile rule: http://streetsblog.net/2012/11/16/one-for-the-dustbin-the-85th-percentile-rule-in-traffic-engineering/.

I have to say, that while I'm against speed limits in general, the 85th percentile rule has been useful from a data analysis standpoint.

First of, all let's talk about the Solomon curve which allegedly proves that the slowest motorist is the most in danger of crashing.

To that, "No!"

This curve seems to only care about rear endings. If you do a mental experiment, you'll see that the faster you drive, the more the chance that your car goes out of control. This is especially true on a curvy road. Plus, the faster you go, the more likely you'll need to overtake over vehicles.

Finally, whether or not you crash isn't that important, but rather how fast you are going when you crash. If we all go sane speeds in controlled areas, we'd be OK with a few crashes every now and then. I got doored twice, hit by two cars and flipped my bicycle, but I didn't even get a scrapped knee in any of the five crashes. It only made me more alert for the future. And yes, in many of them I was NOT wearing a helmet so there. :P

So why the hell am I against speed limits?

Because it's one of the fake solutions that make people feel good while doing nothing. Look at how scared we are thinking of getting rid of speed limits. Guess what? They don't exist now.

How many people brag about how they speed all the time and get away with it. What a capital offense. Since everyone gets away with it all the time, it's pointless. Plus, usually nobody gets hurt so it's a victimless crime. Finally, as the police say, they are more concerned with murder and kidnappings to care about dead cyclists. So if some idiots want to race on the freeway no big deal.

Here's the thing, though.

We can control speed by traffic calming measures. Get rid of the speed limit and we realize that we have to control people's speed anyway so instead of making a sign, we make a lasting change that actually works. This will free up tons of resources from the police so they can actually walk around our community instead of wasting their time writing tickets which just piss people off.

Plus, if we keep changing the speed limit when people speed it's the same as not having a speed limit after all.

If people abuse it and race, we can still arrest them for driving too fast for conditions. In fact, we'll have more resources to focus on this when the police aren't wasting time on tickets. 

But why do I love a rule that I want to abolish?

Because for crash data, it makes it easier to guess how fast the motorist was driving. I don't know the rules in Australia, but the data on speed limit and death rate is super tight--much, much tighter than any other variable.

Thus, I suggest having the notion of speed zones, which means that instead of making a speed limit, we make a speed target. For example, if we have a single lane, cross walks, and frequent stops, we'd assume that the speed target is 20 MPH. If instead we widen the road, eliminate stops at intersections, and make the scenery boring, we're looking at motorists going from 50-60 MPH. And so on.

Let's be realistic. Changing numbers on a sign that people speed past and writing tickets to every thousandth unlucky motorist is NOT going to make people drive at sane speeds.

  <title>More on Cycling Triage</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/11/19/more-on-cycling-triage/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I don't know much about the political process, but I do think that we are practicing reverse triage when it comes to cycling.

Recently, I posted about how we can use the medical term, triage, and apply it to infrastructure, but what does this really mean?

"Triage (play /ˈtriːɑːʒ/ (UK English) or /triːˈɑːʒ/ (US English)) is the process of determining the priority of patients' treatments based on the severity of their condition."

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triage

Everyone is going to have different standards, but here's what I see from the past.

Places like the beaches have a boardwalk which is wonderful infrastructure for cycling. Since they are not commuting from one place to another, this is an excellent example of "build it and they will ride."

On the other hand, to actually _get_ to the beach from most neighborhoods in San Diego, it's a nightmare.

Why?

I think that it's because our current notion of triage is to build infrastructure where people are all ready cycling aka demand. Also, to build infrastructure to where the neighborhood demands it.

Sounds reasonable that they are only responding to demand, right?

No. 

This morning, I have decided the top three criteria for cycling infrastructure.

1. Where the speeds are greater than 50 MPH and there are pre-existing cyclists. This is because these roads are the most dangerous. In a hospital, the nurse treats those most likely to die without treatment first. Here we should treat roads that are most likely to kill first.

2. Once #1 is taken care of, we should work on all the arterials and either make a better connection than what they have all ready by mixing with traffic or at least make the ride safer and more pleasant. One way that this can be accomplished is by connecting cul-de-sacs and so on. We can use eminent domain to do this if we need to.

We should do this because people are dying. Not of car accidents, though there are a few of those, but worse, of disease which could be prevented if only people got outside and exercised a little.

So let's set aside, for a second the measly six or seven hundred dead cyclists and think about the 599,413 deaths of people who died of heart disease A YEAR. [http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/lcod.htm]


Does that make a more compelling case for cycling infrastructure? I know we can't save them all, but if we could prevent only 10% of those, we'd have 10 billion more dollars for infrastructure. [http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/publications/AAG/dhdsp.htm]

Note that these numbers are highly inaccurate. We'd probably save way more money due to the nature of sedentary diseases being spread over many categories such as "Adult" Diabetes which we have build our environment into becoming a kids disease, too.

Seeing as we spent a trillion dollars after losing 3000 people to 9/11, you'd think a couple of billion to save HALF A MILLION AMERICANS would be something that we'd put on the table. 

Bzzt. Wrong. Instead we hear about electric cars and drilling in Alaska. Wow, innovative ideas.

3. Finally, and I'll put this in all caps, we should build infrastructure WHERE PEOPLE DO NOT ALL READY RIDE. I'll say it again. Building infrastructure where people ride is like feeding people who all ready had dinner. It does not make sense. Sure, we should improve all areas of the US. Fine. But since we have a limited budget where we're spending our money on helmets and beta-blockers instead of sweet cycle tracks, we need to triage.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Aestheticism and Cycling</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[For the past few months or so, I've been all about safety and preventing heart disease.

Lest, we forget what this is all about, I'll rehash.

Fun!

Cycling, for me, most of all is fun.

Loud machine noises, death, yellow vests, helmets, rights, fitness, health, weight, and rules are NOT FUN.

Most fun of all, is riding in well designed infrastructure.

It's as if I were taken care of by a higher maternal being. A beautiful kind nanny. :)

Recently, when doing other research, I came on this:

Aestheticism (or the Aesthetic Movement) is an art movement supporting the emphasis of aesthetic values more than socio-political themes for literature, fine art, music and other arts. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aestheticism]

This is definitely how I view cycling. Getting to the venue needs to be just as fun and beautiful as the venue itself. Forget about commuting and traffic and impatience and efficiency.

In with the joy of climbing a steep hill and of feeling one getting better and better, every day, with almost no effort.

This sums it up:

"The British decadent writers were much influenced by the Oxford professor Walter Pater and his essays published during 1867–68, in which he stated that life had to be lived intensely, with an ideal of beauty."

Thus, the notion of beauty has to be outside as well as in.

There's more:

"Writers of the Decadent movement used the slogan "Art for Art's Sake" (L'art pour l'art), the origin of which is debated."

Yes, or we could say, "cycling for cycling's sake"; sounds like a motto.

"The artists and writers of Aesthetic style tended to profess that the Arts should provide refined sensuous pleasure, rather than convey moral or sentimental messages."

Yes! Screw the environment, let's ride our bicycles because it gives us a great deal of sensuous pleasure.

"The artists and writers of Aesthetic style tended to profess that the Arts should provide refined sensuous pleasure, rather than convey moral or sentimental messages."

Exactly. I have always felt the same about infrastructure. I want it regardless of the safety factor because it gives me a lot of pleasure. The fact that it is super safe is only icing on the delicious cake.

"These perspectives opposed or deemphasized the importance of the rationality of human beings. Instead, they concentrated on the experience of one's own existence."

Yes! We don't have to get around in the most efficient manner. We don't have to live our lives like adults. We don't have to impress humorless and prissy people.

We only have to ride our bicycles and enjoy the cool and refreshing breeze on our skin!]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So many times, I fantasize about what I'd like to do with that asshole motorist.

Still, when I am at peace and most mentally stable, I feel that I'd like to just forgive.

I'm not saying that others should do this, but I feel, strongly, that I'd like to be that person who forgives everything even if the person deliberately attacked me with his vehicle.

I am NOT this person, but this is what I aspire to be.

I saw this great <a href="http://tinybuddha.com/blog/relieve-physical-pain-by-releasing-your-grievances/">Tiny Buddha Post on forgiveness, </a>and it inspired me.

“Remembering a wrong is like carrying a burden on the mind.”

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently on a message board someone pointed out the very brilliant notion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy_of_hazard_control">Hierarchy of Hazard Controls.</a>

Like a bolt of lightning this has really changed how I think about cycling safety. Or should I say that it justifies the things I have all ready believed.

First off, what is this hierarchy?

"Hierarchy of hazard control is a system used in industry to minimize or eliminate exposure to hazards."

Sounds good, but the thing that stuns me is that we don't hear about this in the cycling world much. 

Why?

For some strange reason, we feel the need to reinvent the wheel for everything in cycling instead of leveraging the decades of modern research on these things. Instead we come up with ideas that are the most useless and push for them.

Here's the brilliant part about the hierarchy:

"A diagram of the hierarchy of hazard control, with the most effective methods at the top and the least effective at the bottom."

The highest form of safety is to eliminate the hazard all together. In cycling, the most obvious danger is motoring. To eliminate motoring means to ride on dedicated bicycle paths. This is pretty obvious. Eliminating motoring is the most effective way of making cycling safer.

At this point, we go down the pyramid seeing as this is not always "realistic". But let's not kid ourselves, when we use words like realistic, we are admitting to ourselves that society is not doing the BEST job that it could.

The rest of these interventions become less and less effective.

The next one is substitution. There are no real alternatives in the cycling world unless they design a car that kills less cyclists somehow.

Moving on to Engineering Controls: "Engineering controls do not eliminate hazards, but rather keep people isolated from hazards."

An example of this is cycle tracks. The cars are still a menace, but we're at least roped off in our little safe area. Note how far we've fallen! Cycle tracks are the THIRD MOST EFFECTIVE safety means for cyclists. Yet people whine that this third rate measure is too expensive. OK then.

Finally, we're getting close to the bottom which is where people put cycling safety. Administrative controls which "...include procedure changes, employee training, and installation of signs and warning labels..."

So here we have share the road signs and cycling safety courses all of which are the second worst forms of safety. I think that overall these are useless, but that's me. Not that we seldom do "procedure changes" which would mean changing traffic laws so that bicycles are NOT treated exactly as vehicles, but we are permitted to take extra steps to ride even more safely such as rolling lights when there's nobody around (avoids right hook) and to ride on the sidewalk. Instead our procedures are hamstrung by the unsafe notion that the people out in the open should mix it up  in the area where they operate heavy machinery because for some reason hanging around a hazard makes us safe. Haha. 

Finally, we scrape the bottom of the barrel which is where we find that most people like pull their most cherished ideas from.

"Personal Protective Equipment (known as PPE) is the least effective way to control hazards. PPE can include gloves, respirators, hard hats, safety glasses, high-visibility clothing, and safety footwear." 

Helmets, lights, and bright clothing. 

"PPE is the least effective means of controlling hazards because of the high potential for the PPE to become ineffective due to damage." 

It has been pointed out that "being visible" is negated by a drunk or by texting, but here we go again.

Best of all there's the fact that PPE's can actually hurt people and INCREASE risk. Suck on that helmet advocates:

"Additionally, some PPE, such as respirators, increase physiological effort to complete a task and, therefore, require medical examinations to ensure the worker can use the PPE without any detrimental risk to his or her own health."]]></content:encoded>

  <title>OSHA, Cycling, and You</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[OSHA, Cycling, and You

Thanks to that anon commenter who first woke me up to the the ccwonderful world of PPE (personal protective equipment)! :)

For the last two days, I've been trolling the OSHA and CDC websites, and I can see that there has been a LOT of work put into the study of safety.

However, in world of cycling, we re-invent the wheel, badly.

Check this out:

http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=9&amp;ved=0CG8QFjAI&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Forosha.org%2Feducate%2Fonlinecourses%2F1241%2F1241FinalPDF.pdf&amp;ei=M4yxUISuL8ebqwH0p4DADg&amp;usg=AFQjCNE29nX9cqJLfqBT3IoIDT50GxBiMg&amp;sig2=zjgAJll4QB3JXWK1uzsM5g

First of all, we will assume that in this case, the state is the employer because the state has created our transportation system, and thus, like a good citizen, should be perILEsonally responsible for the risks that it creates.

How is the state doing?

Not so well.

First of all, is this post a submarine part of my anti-helmet crusade? No! It's openly anti-helmet.

Second, let's rehash that the good nation of Australia has proven that many, many, many people can die while wearing PPE. How tragic!

However, maybe pro-helmet people should at least THINK of STFU of their blame and shame of those who hurt ourselves while NOT wearing a helmet.

If we have to eat the deaths of those of us without helmets then helmet promoters must take equal blame for promoting useless safety equipment when people die.

What does OSHA have to say about injuries while wearing PPE?

"For example, one study indicated that 70% of the workers experiencing hand injuries were not wearing gloves.
Hand injuries to the remaining 30% of the workers who were wearing gloves were caused by the gloves being
either inadequate, damaged, or the wrong type for the type of hazard present."

All caps for the skimmer commenters: 

"ACCORDING TO OSHA, IF YOU ARE HURT WHILE WEARING A HELMET,THE HELMET IS INADEQUETE FOR THE TYPE OF HAZARD PRESENT."

Thus, if you admit that a helmet will not protect you from all road injuries, you are pushing an inadequate solutions. From the other day, we learned that bottom of the safety barrel interventions are ONLY to be used as a last resort unless they are totally adequate. Thus, the employer, the state has created unsafe working conditions (cycling conditions) and suggesting a useless band-aid for this is not recommended by the safety experts.

"Personal protective equipment will be provided, used, and maintained when it has been determined that its use is required and that such use will lessen the likelihood of occupational injury and/or illness."

But most normal people have all ready agreed that a helmet will not save you in the most common way to die which is getting hit by a high speed car. Thus helmet advocates are pushing INADEQUATE equipment which is not recommended.

Not only that, but a poor cyclist, by OSHA standards, is NOT obligated to buy a useful helmet:

"Although employers may at times arrange for employees to provide their own protective equipment, it's important to understand that in such circumstances the employer remains responsible and accountable to assure its adequacy, ie helmet does not meet standards, the state should be liable for injury and death. I don't recall anyone suing the state for a defective helmet thus, I feel that the roads don't meet minimum OSHA standards.

"Remember, PPE that is defective...is not PPE."

This is why I say that cycling helmets are useless.

"(1) The employer shall assess the workplace to determine if hazards are present, or are likely to be present, which necessitate the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). If such hazards are present, or likely to be present, the employer shall:

(i) Select, and have each affected employee use, the types of PPE that will protect the affected employee from the hazards identified in the hazard assessment;"

For cyclists, high speed cars are the biggest hazard that they would identify on their quaint walk through, of the high speed roads that I ride on.

There is no cycling helmet that will protect for this hazard. Thus, I suggest other means on the pyramid such as engineering controls and GASP elimination of the hazards.

As OSHA says:

"PPE devices alone should not be relied on to provide protection against hazards, but should be used in conjunction with engineering controls and other management controls."

When one reads engineering controls, for the most part, in cycling, this is infrastructure:

"Engineering controls are the "first line of defense" against injury/illness, because they have the potential to completely eliminate a hazard, and do not
rely on human behavior to be effecti ve."

I skimmed through the walk though, and I'll circle back to another post.

For now, here's a chestnut:

"Select the protective equipment which ensures a level of protection greater than the minimum required to protect employees from the hazards;"

Note that this means that if you claim it will protect against head injury on a VC road--I mean on a road where traffic if 50 MPH, the PPE should be rated for 60 MPH. I wonder who will sell me this helmet. Do I hear a Nut CaseTM. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>OSHA: Six-Step Assessment Process </title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Here I continue the helmet shaming tirade that I began a few weeks ago. Our wonderful journey has taken us into the realm of real safey, Instead of the nonsensical world of NHTSA where it seems like their safety tips were made by an intern and MS Works TM. 

OSHA actually has the notion of a walk through for a dangerous sight. Here we pretend that they care enough to walk down the 50 MPH highways that they have designed so that they can say something a bit more enlightened and caring than "put a plastic bucket on your head."

This is from the excellent 1241FinalPDF that I had quoted from earlier.

"Step One: Conduct a survey

The area supervisor, safety officer and/or experienced employee should conduct a walk-through survey of the areas in question. The purpose of the survey is to identify sources of hazards to workers and co-workers."

Note, I'd love to see these safety "officers" from the NHTSA walking down Fairmount, hugging the should, hanging onto the guard rail and hoping that a fellow "co-worker" doesn't drift into the two inch should. Haha.

"Step Two: Determine sources of hazards"

I don't think that the safety officer would think that they themselves are a hazard. They'd probably think that the high speed cars are the problem. 

"Sources of motion; i.e., machinery or processes where any movement of tools, machine elements or particles could exist, or movement of personnel that could result in collision with stationary objects;"

"Step Three: Organize the data"

"Following the walk-through survey, it is necessary to organize the data and information for use in the assessment
of hazards. The objective is to prepare for an analysis of the hazards in the environment to enable proper selection of protective equipment. In addition, injury/accident data should be reviewed to help identify problem areas."

Hmmm, unlike other "safety" write ups, this does not say, as other have said that the workers themselves are the inherent safety problem. Contrast this to anything about cycling which says that "cycling is a big source of danger."

"Step Four: Analyze the data"

" * Nature of the hazard,
   * Degree of risk.
   * Seriousness or severity of potential injury
   * Possibility of exposure to several hazards simultaneously"

"Step Five: Select the Personal Protective Equipment"

"Involve employees in the selection process;"

Hmm, I've never been consulted on whether I thought a helmet was a good idea. Yet another fundamental step missing before we blindly and haphazardly issue PPE when it's not appropriate.

"Select the protective equipment which ensures a level of protection greater than the minimum required to protect employees from the hazards;"

Again, I don't think that there are any PPEs aka helmets that will make a difference. Seems like a huge missing step here in the cycling helmet world.

"Fit the user with the protective device and give instructions on care and use of the PPE. It is very
important that end users be made aware of all warning labels for and limitations of their PPE."

Limitations,what are those? Again, I'm still searching for how fast the cars can go before I die when wearing a Snell Rated helmet. 

"Step Six: Reassess for Hazards"

Haha, if we didn't look once, are we going to look twice?

In summary, I have found that recommendation of helmets by various organizations when they have not done a proper assessment to be highly negligent on the organization's part. I'd suggest that we get some people trained in proper work safety techniques and apply them to our road systems. Otherwise, it's amateur hour every day.

A special thanks to the morons who cut n' paste studies that they don't understand and apply them indiscriminately to every single cycling situation instead of getting out from behind their desks and confronting the realities that we face on a daily basis.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Great NYT article on Jefferson and politics.

What does this have to do with cycling? 

Everything!

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/26/opinion/obama-should-socialize-with-congressional-leaders.html?_r=0

Here are some things that he recommended:

1. Take some complete breaks:

"During both of his terms, on the eve of each Congressional session, President Thomas Jefferson warned friends that, in our vernacular, he was about to go offline. “As Congress will meet this day week, we begin now to be in the bustle of preparation,” he wrote a family member. “When that begins, between the occupations of business and of entertainment, I shall become an unpunctual correspondent.” 

2. Socialize with all even your political "enemies" and treat them all as humans:

"Men who liked and respected and enjoyed one another were more likely to cultivate the virtuous habits that would truly enable the nation’s citizens to engage in “the pursuit of happiness.” An affectionate man living in harmony with his neighbors was more likely to understand the mutual sacrifices of opinion necessary to a republic’s success. "

Contrast this with the amount of bile we have whenever a cyclist dies on both sides of the fence.

Oh, Jefferson, where art thou?

3. Ride daily.

OK, this is a stretch since Jefferson rode a horse, but still, it bears mentioning that he kept such a schedule:

"He began the day working at his writing table, doing paperwork and receiving callers from early morning until midday; that gave him, he figured, “an interval of 4 hours for riding, dining and a little unbending.”

4. Don't waste time on silly arguments:

"Yet Jefferson could be ruthless about the use of his limited time in power. To create an ethos of supra-partisan civility would have required bringing politicians of opposing views together under his aegis. Jefferson had only four or eight years to impress himself on the country and was unwilling to waste any of those hours presiding over arguments, even polite ones, between differing factions at his table."

Yes, this is one that I can learn from.

5. Set the agenda:

"He chose, then, to use dinner at the President’s House to put himself and his own agenda at the center of things."

This means that while he was polite to guests, he entertained all, and answered his mail, he didn't bow to every whim of everyone that he met.

He believed in constant conversation between the president and lawmakers, for “if the members are to know nothing but what is important enough to be put in a public message,” Jefferson wrote, “it becomes a government of chance and not of design.”

Let's look to Jefferson for his brilliant social skills as well as his adherence to his own message and schedule. 

These are truly traits to be admired.]]></content:encoded>

Double no. :)

"I fell off my bike and my helmet broke in half. If that were my head, I'd be a vegetable."

Maybe yes, maybe no.

Converse story:

"I know someone who fell off his bike and he did NOT wear a helmet. Now he has a plate in his head. If only for a helmet he'd be here today."

And

"Blah, blah, blah, blah blah..."

Let me clarify, once again, our position:

Those of us who are "anti-helmet" just want to be left alone. That's all.

If you have a fetish for plastic hats, wear it. I won't bug you on the road. Can you do us the same courtesy and stop bugging us? That's all we want. Just some silence on this tired, tired, issue.

As for people's stupid stories, one can speculate all day. Unless we see people who actually have fallen off their bicycles with helmets on, we can't say much if we are going to be accurate.

I'm not saying that a helmet does not help, ever. I'm just saying that:

1. It's common sense that "helmets save lives." Since everyone knows this, why continue to talk about it. Those who are against helmets have read the literature so leave us alone unless there is SOMETHING NEW YOU CAN SAY ABOUT HELMETS. We all heard the story where you fell off the bike and your helmet broke. A million times. Please say something original.

2. There are few protective devices that NEVER work. This is not the standard we should use. We should think about the entire impact that these devices have on society. I think that overall, they put the wearer at greater risk. See the literature for details.

3. Even if "helmets save lives", so what? Smoking causes cancer. Drinking too much is fatal. Driving is super deadly for those under 35 YO. So what? What are we going to do with this info besides REPEATING OURSELVES AD NAUSEUM.

4. Instead of repeating your stupid stories about falling off your bike, tell me why did the mandatory helmet law in Australia and NZ wind up as a dismal failure? Why did so many people die despite having helmets? What if we spent the helmet money on things that actually worked? Would you be willing to forgo a helmet in this case? Finally, for those who think we should wear helmets in the UK and US because they are "not like NL", will you be willing to STFU about helmets once we reach this safety levels? Or is this a crazy fetish that you must constant harass people about?]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Palling Around With Criminals</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Over the years, Democrats have been accused of being "soft on crime" [http://www.topix.com/forum/city/bridgeport-ct/TKDGE6ONRDPC0CD0M] but Assemblyman Declan O’Scanlon, R-Monmout actually feels like the state should encourage it. 


http://www.courierpostonline.com/article/20121127/NEWS01/311270020?gcheck=1&amp;nclick_check=1

Note the title, "Drivers adapt to red-light cameras". 

No, the motorists are not "adapting" they are following the fucking law for once.

Why do people think that they have an exception from criminal activity if they do it in a car? Oh, because Hollywood says that it's funny. [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=movie+funny+chase+scene&amp;gbv=2&amp;oq=movie+funny+chase+scene&amp;gs_l=heirloom-hp.3...569.4155.0.4345.29.25.3.1.1.0.145.1814.22j3.25.0...0.0...1c.1.nrdS6kA3fho]

“What we are doing is making people paranoid — causing them to slam on the brakes at the slightest hint a light might change, or deciding to fail to make even an absolutely safe right turn on red,” he said."

Good! I think that right on red is dangerous and should be illegal.

What does he want people do to, run red lights?

Yes.

"The department’s report drew immediate criticism from Assemblyman Declan O’Scanlon, R-Monmouth, who wants the cameras removed. He called the program “a dismal failure,” saying DOT statistics show the net costs of accidents had climbed by more than $1 million at intersections with cameras."

This is because the cameras don't pay for themselves.

http://www.ajc.com/news/news/roswell-looks-past-red-light-cameras/nS4N9/

“Generally speaking it does look like it costs more to operate those cameras than the revenue you get,” county spokesman Joe Sorenson said.

What nonsense. 

Do officers have to "pay for themselves" when they investigate a murder? The whole point is that we pay taxes for protections, we get it and then our money is gone. That's basically how people spend money in a normal universe.

It seems that red light cameras are causing people to stop for red lights which is important if you walk or ride a bicycle.

“The violations had fallen so significantly that we were at the point in our budget where we couldn’t afford to keep them,” Snellville Police Chief Roy Whitehead said.

What the fuck!

Also, there's the spectre of cars getting "rear-ended" if they stop for a red light. Umm, what about t-bones? These are going down.

Plus where are the assholes who believe that the law must be enforced at all costs no matter what even if it's less safe? Those who think that a cyclist should come to a complete stop at each and every stop sign even when there's no one around and to put their foot on the ground. I didn't see a single mention of the phrase "scofflaw motorists."

I do think that roads should be made safer so that even motorists who want to jump lights will be safe. I feel all alone in this as I am the only one I know who embraces Sustainable Safety.

Still, where's the cold hard rationality when it comes to this lawlessness where "if you commit a crime, you deserve to get hurt."

Note, I do NOT agree with above but, with cyclists, I see that attitude constantly.

Finally, I'd like to mention that if you need to "slam on your breaks to stop for a red light" you are driving too fast. That little tap on the back of your car should be a wake up call that you need to SLOW THE FUCK DOWN. 

And if you hit someone from behind, you were following too closely. Again, I learned all this in driver's ed; I wonder what they teach now a days?]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Tips For Motorists: I</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Note that this is a joke:

1. Have a backup plan. While motoring is a comfortable and easy way to get places, you put yourself at risk if you rely on owning a single occupant passenger vehicle to get around.

A myriad of factors can take your ability to drive yourself around, and thus you should live and work in a place that has alternate options such as walking, cycling or public transportation. 

NEVER LIVE IN A PLACE WHERE MOTORING IS THE ONLY OPTION BECAUSE YOU RISK BEING TOTALLY IMMOBILE SHOULD AN UNFORSEEN ACCIDENT OCCURS.

One could lose one's license, one could have a medical condition that makes it unsafe to drive, one could get in an accident and get injured, one could get one's car stolen, one's car can break down.

Thus, the first step towards safe motoring is to have an alternate way to get around should the need arise.

2. Test your backup plan.

Losing one's license should not be the first time that one tests their backup plan. Thus, one should try to take the bus to work at least one time. If it turns out that it's impractical then one should move closer to work.

3. Drive a brightly colored car. Floursescent yellow is best, but any bright color will prevent accidents. Avoid black and gray as they are hard to see on the roads.

4. No distractions. It's totally useless for a cyclist or pedestrian to wear flashing lights and orange vests if you are going to look at your cell phone. No music either. Driving is an extremely dangerous task where a split second decision could force you to live with the blood one someone's hands for life. Probably better to take the radio out of your car, too.

5. Roll down the windows. Modern cars are so quiet that it's as if you are cycling around with head phones. But unlike a cyclist, you put everyone else in extreme risk. It's only fair that you strain your ears to hear as much as possible in case you can save a life!

6. Wear a fire proof clothing. Though it's extremely rare, if you are one of those who's car catches on fire, you can save your life. Remember, if it saves even a single life, no inconvenience is silly or a waste of time.

7. No need to worry about a helmet. After all, you wear one while walking around, don't you? If not, you should get one and wear it at all times especially when crossing the street, walking up stairs, and ALWAYS in the shower where most head injuries occur.

8. Comfortable shoes. No high heels. No business shoes, no sandles. There are driving shoes available. Buy these special shoes and change them each time you get into and out of the car. Don't wear them outside the car because you can mess them up which will make driving more dangerous.

9. Have fun. After all, fun is what it's all about. But you can only have fun while riding safely.

  <title>The Anti-Mororist Motorist</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2013/01/04/the-anti-mororist-motorist/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Since cyclists are all ready stigmatized in the US, I try to downplay the fact that I ride a bicycle at all in order to have more harmonious relationships with my peers.

That's right, cycling may be a "right" and legal, but in social terms, it can be one small step above admitting to dog fighting.

This is why, I NEVER complain about motorists to motorists: they tend to have a very thin skin and to be very insecure whenever I mention the most innoculous thing about automobiles. 

However, other motorists have the priviledge to whine about one another.

Here's a very, very stupid person whining:

<a href="http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/makes+mistakes+Only+some+them+crimes/7640985/story.html">We all makes mistakes. Only some of them are crimes.</a>

"The verdict was probably the right one, deeply unsatisfying as it may be to loved ones. As motorists, we are, in effect, legally allowed to commit errors, even serious ones, without ending up in handcuffs."

Um, yes, anyone who reads <a href="http://bikinginla.wordpress.com/">Biking In LA</a> knows this. However, motorists are shocked at this all the time.

"Every driver makes mistakes, we mortals with airbags.

And if there were criminal charges every time we had a lapse in judgment on the road, we’d all be in jail."

Basically, he's saying that everyone is too incompetent to drive safely. Um, if you are incompetent to drive because of drinking, you will lose your license and get fined. But if you are basically a bumbling idiot when sober and you choose to drive, is this not the same?

If I freely choose to do something that I know could kill someone and then it does kill someone, am I not at fault?

  <title>Utter And Complete Absense of Personal Responsibility or Public Shaming into Silence</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/12/05/utter-and-complete-absense-of-personal-responsibility-or-public-shaming-into-silence/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[OK, this story totally pissed me off:

<a href="http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/makes+mistakes+Only+some+them+crimes/7640985/story.html">We all makes mistakes. Only some of them are crimes.</a>

First a bit of background about me.

I am not of the whole, lock em up and throw away the key kind of guy.

I actually do agree with the spirit of this post in some kind of general sense. A tiny mistake for a motorist should not be the end of their world. I wouldn't wish the guilt and pain of running over a child, which happens about 5000 times a year in the US, usually by parents, on anyone.

But you'd think that there would be some kind of basic kindness or respect from those of us who are obsessed with reducing (or God forbid eliminating this form of suffering). I don't think that there is, and I'm actually a little bit embarrassed to talk about this stuff in person.

I think it's because people think that I'm accusing them of some kind of crime just for driving a car. I'm not.

Conversely, I won't kiss the bull on the ass, either like 99% plus of bike advocates do.

So here's the skinny. If someone is motoring and they hit someone and they really, really didn't mean it, I believe them. They shouldn't be hung or anything else. In fact, I don't really know what should happen to them. The whole thought of punishing anyone makes me feel a bit sick my stomach. 

Also, there's the talk from Than Geoff [http://dhammatalks.org/mp3_index.html] where he said that one should only worry about one's own actions because it's a lot less to worry about. I agree!

In principle, but there's a blog post to be written.

Yes, the part where ones hits someone is not their fault. Driving is not their fault. There's no other way to get around. In many places literally no other way. 

OK.

But what about choosing to live in a motoring community? Still not one's fault because it was cheaper and one needed a yard.

But this was a decision made which took a lot of time. There was time to do research and to back out. Still not one's fault.

How about the guy who build the development motoring, only. Is it his fault?

Probably not because he needed to make buck and put food on his family. Also, he built it to "code" which means that he followed the law.

Not his fault.

So what about the one who wrote the code?

They were responding to "accepted practice" and "community input". Not the government's fault.

What about the community who created that input? Is it their fault?

Probably not. They were only following their friends and family. One person's decision does NOT matter at all. As I cruise down Fairmount, I can tell you a few things. I'm not saving a child's life. I'm not saving the Earth. I'm just dodging heavy machinery piloted by strangers who were told by the sale's person that if they bought this one thing, they would own the planet.

So if it's not the community's fault then who is it? Who is the community?

I think that this brings us back to the person who first hit the cyclists above. They are the community.

But like my good friend Kelly, said, "it's nobody's fault."

Or perhaps everyone is to cowardly to say something. 

I am.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Are Gated Communities Fighting a War on the Motorist?</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The funny thing about "War on the Motorist" nonsense becomes really clear when you see where many of the people who claim such a war are actually waging it themselves.

The strange thing about things like traffic calming and restricting motoring access is that you never, ever see one complain that one who lives in a suburban gated community is anti-motorist, but in a sense they are far more restrictive than anything that's been done in places like NYC who have made a quantum leap in livability due to their traffic calming measures.

Here's the skinny. Gates are anti-motoring because not everyone can get inside. It's like a very, very selective and expensive congestion charge. You need to either live in the community or know someone who does to drive there.

And what about cul-de-sacs? They, too, are there to make motoring through a neighborhood totally impossible. Again, way more restrictive than taking our a single lane.

But traffic calming is done in "public roads", right? People don't live there, do they.

Yes, they do. The people who come out against traffic calming often live in perfectly traffic calmed enclaves, and they fight traffic calming for their own selfish ends. 

Let's stop being wimps when it comes to traffic calming. Those who are against it must be called out for what they are: self serving hypocrites who are 100% on board with traffic calming when it benefits them, only.

Who whines about not being able to drive his car down the middle of the mall? Who is there asking for the cul-de-sac in his back yard to be connected so we can get some large trucks driving next to his bedroom? And let's take down those gates and widen the roads.

In fact, there's not a single person who thinks that areas should be free and quiet from annoying traffic sounds. 

If not, why not have a traffic calming meeting on the grass next to a freeway? One can talk and talk about how the traffic calming is terrible, but alas, we can not hear you above the auto noises.

The fact is nobody likes to be outside near high speed traffic. Those who advocate for it are happy with it as long as they are only making other people miserable and not themselves.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Seldom do I find such a <a href="http://departmentfortransport.wordpress.com/2012/11/29/breaking-news-nothing-has-changed/">fantastic new friend!</a>

In the latest post, this blogger says "You can stick your £20m up your arse".


And I say, "yes!"

Why so angry?

I guess I can ask the same thing about those who celebrate such an insult. Why so dishonest?

Twenty million will do NOTHING in the UK so to say, "thanks" is a lie because it's actually a thanks for nothing.

I can't emphasize what a tiny amount of money this is for a country with 50 million people.

I know it's dubious to compare dollars to pounds, but I'll do so anyway: "According to FHWA’s 2009 statistics, $70.9 billion is needed to address the current backlog of deficient bridges" according to <a href="http://t4america.org/resources/bridges/overview/">Transportation for America.</a>

This is just for REPAIRS!

As I said in the past, I feel that by making things too far to walk by zoning normal cities out of existence and by making it deadly to cycle, the government has a moral duty to mititage the wrong that they have done. Twenty million would build a few miles of cycle tracks at best. It would take several lifetimes, at that rate, to undo the harm that motoring has done. At this rate, we would have all died, run out of oil, and probably spoiled our chances of our children of living at all. 

It's such a nasty tease, I agree. No money would be better because then it would so obvious that they don't care.

"Because £20m spread across the country is going to do nothing for cycling, except maybe the installation of more of the same kind of crap we’re used to getting, and maybe some more pointless posters to ‘encourage’ people to ride a bike, and more vehicular cycling training which will enable cycling to continue to tread water as it has done for decades."

Spot on.

Heck,they are even a bit more generous than I am:

"I wouldn’t mind quite so much if there was some sort of plan of how to spend the money, or some decent minimum standards of cycle infrastructure which local authorities must meet. But there isn’t."

Yes, it would be better up their arses. At least this would be effective in getting some kind of change happen. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>NHTSA is a Joke</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/12/11/nhtsa-is-a-joke/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm actually just responding to Ted's post which was <a href="http://bikinginla.wordpress.com/2012/12/11/traffic-deaths-are-down-unless-youre-on-two-wheels-or-two-feet-or-driving-a-big-ass-truck/">spot on as usual.</a> Thanks for writing my blog for me, Ted.

LTR's can once again ignore this as it's more of a repeat if you didn't guess from the title.

"While the overall traffic fatalities showed a nearly 2% decline, bicycle deaths shot up 8.7%, to 677 throughout the U.S."

As an article that Ted linked to said, it's actually impossible to determine whether this is a result of "safety in numbers" as we have no denominatory. Safety in numbers basically says that the number of cycling accidents remains relatively stable as the number of cyclists increase which is a statistical truth, but also a head scratcher.

We'd expect accidents to go up as cyclists to go up. In this case they did, but did accidents really rise with the increase in cycling? Since the deaths last year were between 600 and 700 for all of US, a 8.7% increase is really small because we are talking about less than 130 deaths spread out across 50 states. That's like 2 more deaths per state. That doesn't sound like a lot at all. I had written, previously about my bad apples theory to explain safety in numbers. Additionally, I had explained that small increases like the one above can be explained by things such as regression to the mean. 

Overally, I see this "increase" as a statistical blip. I usually round to the nearest 100 in these cases which means that like last year, the number of deaths is still between 600 and 700 for the whole country.

I don't know if cycling did increase nation wide or not. As the article that Ted linked to, <a href="http://gettingaroundsac.wordpress.com/2012/12/10/pedestrian-and-bicyclist-fatalities-up-more-data-flaws/">nobody know.</a> That's because the comical NHTSA doesn't care.

From the article:

"No statistics are presented on the fatality rate per bicycle mile traveled. Why? I believe that it is because NHTSA is too lazy or too disinterested to compile information on bicycle miles traveled. Though pedestrian miles traveled would be difficult to compile, at least a rate could be developed per pedestrian trip, which would be a more accurate measure of the rate of fatalities. Again, the NHTSA can’t be bothered. I am certainly not the first to point out that pedestrian and bicyclist fatality counts are a mis-measure of safety, yet the federal, state, and local governments continue to ignore the issue."

I'd like to beat more on the "doesn't care" dead horse a little bit later. I would like to say that besides telling you to "wear a helmet", the NHTSA doesn't really do ANYTHING to make the streets safer at all for cycling. Not a single thing. Thus, I don't even think that they should weigh in on any aspect of safety seeing as their only data to back up their insulting safety advice is a study that's been long, long discredited, and they are deaf and dumb to spending any money on cycling safety.

In fact, the main purpose of the NHTSA is to recommend better air bags which means that due to the notion of "safetey compensation" this will make the roads MORE deadly for cyclists because people tend to push the limits of safety. Thanks NHTSA.

Here's some examples from wikipedia how utterly useless they are:

"NHTSA has issued few regulations in the past 25 years. Most of the reduction in vehicle fatality rates during the last third of the 20th century were gained from the initial NHTSA safety standards during 1968–1984 and subsequent voluntary changes in vehicle crashworthiness by vehicle manufacturers...

"...Despite the evolution of the North American auto market to include most of the world's major automakers, and the ongoing proliferation of U.S. safety regulations, the previously-existing market oligopoly still exerts strong influence: American vehicle equipment and construction regulations are based almost entirely on Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) standards, which were written almost entirely by U.S. automakers.

"In a 2004 book by former General Motors safety researcher Leonard Evans, government data (FARS for the U.S.) showed other countries achieving safety performance improvements over time greater than those achieved by the United States."

Seriously, should dismantle this organization which seems like it just increases the barrier to entry to foreign auto makers which keeps us stuck on the treadmill of depending on the auto industry to keep too many of our citizens busy doing work which ultimately increases heart disease, obesity, sudden death, and a silly, nonsensical sense of entitlement due to the irresponible and childish use of debt.

Thanks, NHTSA, a total joke organization.

Anyway, I knew that they sucked when I noticed that they had TSA in their name. :)

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Washington Post, like most publications, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/rising-number-of-soldiers-being-dismissed-for-failing-fitness-tests/2012/12/08/13d2e444-40b8-11e2-ae43-cf491b837f7b_print.html">totally misses the boat on cycling.</a>

From the article:

"Retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling said he was floored by what he found in 2009 when he was assigned to overhaul the Army’s training system. Seventy-five percent of civilians who wanted to join the force were ineligible, he said. Obesity was the leading cause."

And yet, as you continue to read the article, they do not talk aobut how the changing transportation system has created a nation of over weight people.

The last few months, I have met no less than half a dozen people who either lost massive amounts of weight or got in great shape from cycling.

That we could get home and work out at the same time should be a super-no brainer.

Instead, you get those who are supposed to "educate" us <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/05/high-school-students-stage-celebratory-bike-ride-get-suspended-for-senior-prank/">making us fat!</a>

"

About 60 students, about one-third of the senior class, took part in the bike ride on Tuesday. They had organized a police escort beforehand, and the city’s mayor, Rob VerHeulen, traveled in the procession in a police car and even handed out doughnuts.

A good time was had by all, except for school Principal Katharine Pennington.  Apparently dismayed at not having been informed about the event, Pennington suspended the participants for the day, forbade them from participating in today’s senior walk — an annual tradition — and said they could potentially not walk during their graduation next week, Rachel Nicks, the mother of one of the participating students, told ABC News."

Where are the right wingers pointing out that this is a grave national security concern?

I am kidding here, but I wanted to say this for a while. If they ban cycling to school then heart disease wins! :)

  <title>Freaky Bike Blindness</title>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm starting to see a huge pattern here in our rush to "fix" the current transportation mess: bicycle blindness (BB).

I don't mean the fact that it's extremely difficult to see a cyclist in front of you while going tens of miles per hour faster despite the canary colors and flashing lights. That's something that can only be fixed by physical separation of the humans from the heavy machinery work area.

What I mean by bicycle blindness is where the bicycle is our fix to our problems and yet it is totally ignored while we chase after a much less tested, more expensive non-solution that perpetuates 99% of the original problems that it's trying to fix.

In this case, <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/2012/12/11/from-horse-power-to-horsepower-to-processing-power/">Freakonomics</a> gets it badly, but predictably, wrong. (We should call them Trollonomics from their posts which are only slightly less histrionic than yours truly). :)

"
If you do peruse it, you’ll see I ended with the hope that technology will bail us out of our transportation problems just like it bailed us out of those caused by the horse. At that time, a deus ex machina descended from the heavens to improbably solve the insoluble. The savior was known as the automobile, and as it went from obscurity to ubiquity in a few decades it banished the working horse—a primary mode of transportation for thousands of years—to oblivion.

There was only one problem with my call for a miraculous technological fix: I did not have the slightest idea what that technology would be."

The bicycle! This was around at the same time that we were "saved" by the auto, yes?

Wrong!

"There is little doubt it will be the biggest innovation in transportation since internal combustion itself. It is cars that drive themselves."

Yes, let's replace something that's dangerous, which makes a huge impact on our environment both natural and human perception, and which takes up too much space with something that's perhaps safer, but has all the rest of the same problems. Great idea.

Plus, let's make it really, really complicated.

Overall, I'd prefer to have well programmed cars in the future than the poorly driven ones in the past.

However, each time we get a solution like this we are seduced away from simpler solutions. Each one, for me, creates a grim, and ugly alternate universe.

Other possible alternate universes of doom include e-bikes, mopeds, and the Zero Death project which aims to make motoring 100% safe, but make cycling and walking to be that much more deadly so we can, by the force of violence, coerce everyone to live the way that we'd like. 

Great job, Freakonomics. 

Idiots! :)

  <title>Why Does Cycling Suck In the US? Part I</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Those of you who are coming for some comedy or meditation, this is not for you. I'm going to continue to examine the government's total lack of concern for their nation's health, national security, safety, sanity, and comfort due to their incredibly inept and inefficient policy on infrastructure.

I'm starting to feel like the Andy Rooney of cycling. I always am whining. Well, it takes a big enough baby to admit when things are messed up and for that I'll be your baby.

Here I'll talk about two documents. First of all: Toward Zero Deaths [www.google.com/url?q=http://www.atssa.com/galleries/default-file/Toward%2520Zero%2520Deaths%2520FINAL.pdf&amp;sa=U&amp;ei=HOrHUM2FBOae2gXz6oGYAw&amp;ved=0CBQQFjAA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHAjdo4hoojAeXnYOoozUpNZOpsnw]

Secondly, 

Safer Infrastructure: [http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=web6%20safer%20infrastructure%20paper&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDIQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fsafety.transportation.org%2Fdoc%2Fweb6%2520Safer%2520Infrastructure%2520White%2520Paper.pdf&amp;ei=LuvHUM7ZDcT42QWwg4D4Bw&amp;usg=AFQjCNG9PaGucGU6JRcIMvOyQW0ahKcQFA&amp;bvm=bv.1354675689,d.b2U]

So why does cycling suck?

One reason, I might speculate, is because we speak English. I know that this sounds silly, but name a single English colonial country which has decent cycling? In Canada, the ex-mayor tore up bike lanes. London, cycling totally sucks and they don't care at all. In NZ and AU, they did us the favor of making plastic hats mandatory thus proving once and for all that they were totally useless for accidents other than those which are not likely to hurt or kill the cyclist anyway.

In other wealthy, Western, countries, there is no notion of the disease known as vehicular cycling. They have a far, far higher mode share and they are gaining all the economic, happiness (Denmark is #1 in world happiness), and physical fitness benefits while we are spending our way to a "fiscal cliff" while we are totally befuddled why most of children are fatasses who are destined towards a life of diabetes, heart disease, and other preventable ailments. Not only does the motoring industry kill more people than child abusers, they ruin more future adult lives.

Thus, my initial hypothesis is that this is because of English language or culture. However, I'll look deeper into the causes and conditions of our unique (among non-English speaking, wealthy, Western nations) that I dub cycle-phobia.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Top Up Vs. Bottom Down: Part II</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/12/12/top-up-vs-bottom-down-part-ii/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I know that the title is screwed up, but I thought it was funny. :)

Suddenly, there's a series where I didn't think that there would be one. This is actually something that LTRs and wanna be LTRs, Smorg, I'm looking at you, should read if they want to understand where I'm headed in my enchanting and intoxicating journey through government road safety planning.

Previously, I talked about top down vs. bottom up. I was speaking about how the bottom up solutions were the most popular for things that the government had no concern about while top down solutions were mandated for things that they cared about.

When we went to high alert after 9/11, that was the ultimate top down solution. While the NHTSA suggests wearing a helmet, that's bottom up aka fend for yourself.

What more can I say on this?

A lot.

I have further classified the types of solutions. 

Let's start with Bottom Up. There are actually two types of bottom up: those which are mandatory and those which are optional. These two can be further classified as those which put the burden of safety on the cyclist or where they put the burden of safety on the motorist. The three foot passing law is a mandatory, bottom up solution which puts the burden of safety on the motorist.

Next, we have the types of top down solutions. These come in two flavors (for now--I'm open to more juicy categories). The most popular will help the motorist only. Due to safety compensation, these will actually make things more dangerous when we are outside of our smoggy PPE's. These are so popular because they protect motorists who break the law, are drunk, and are shitty, clueless drivers. Yes, the government spends billions looking out for these people. Think of this the next time they say a cyclist deserves to die when she ran a stop sign after drinking a beer while listening to music and of course, sans helmet. I'd mandate the death penalty for doing that if I were a judge. (Just kidding, no I won't).

Second are those top down interventions that help cyclists, motorists, and pedestrians. They make anyone more likely to cycle and anyone who's not blitheringly insane to enjoy their ride better. Making things easier for cyclists tends to help the other modes as well.

These are highly unpopular and we must fight tooth and nail for them. They are not budgeted and our government wants to cut all funding for them forever.

In the future, I'll look into the details of why I feel this way.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Obama Misses Huge Opportunity To Save Lives</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I like Obama, I really do.

I voted for him because I thought that he was the biggest rags to riches story, ever, and I like a fairy tale before I cast my vote for the most powerful and influential office in the land. :)

But in his recent speech, this guy is really letting me down.

At first, we were off to a good start: "‘These Tragedies Must End,’ Obama Says".

"In a surprisingly assertive speech at a memorial service for the 27 victims, including 20 children, Mr. Obama said that the country had failed to protect its young and that its leaders could no longer sit by idly because “the politics are too hard.” While he did not elaborate on what action he would propose, he said that “these tragedies must end.” 

“No single law, no set of laws can eliminate evil from the world or prevent every senseless act of violence in our society,” he said. “But that can’t be an excuse for inaction.” He added that “in the coming weeks I’ll use whatever power this office holds” in an effort “aimed at preventing more tragedies like this.”

I thought, "yes!" the constant tragedy of road deaths and unlivable streets will END! Hope burns alive.

Then I was dismayed.

"Among other things, Democrats said they would push to renew an assault rifle ban that expired in 2004 and try to ban high-capacity magazines like those used by Mr. Lanza in Newtown. The president also said he would work with law enforcement and mental health professionals, as well as parents and educators."

What?

While gun control is a topic that I have almost no interest in, have guns or not just leave me out of it, I am really, really disappointed by this COMPLETE LACK OF DISCUSSION OF THE NUMBER ONE KILLER OF THIS DEMOGRAPHIC.

People like to dismiss these things as accidents, but if you get backed over by your parents, does that make the pain any less?

It seems that our president is either in denial and ignorant of the road deaths or he's too politically craven to take on the "bull in the China shop".

Obama continues:

“Because what choice do we have?” he added. “We can’t accept events like this as routine. Are we really prepared to say that we’re powerless in the face of such carnage? That the politics are too hard? Are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of our freedom?” 

Yes! we have a choice. We can totally accept things like they are and allow the deaths to continue. 

Ironically, someone who does get things right, Bloomberg spoke up: "An earlier version of this article misquoted Mayor Bloomberg’s call for Mr. Obama to take action on gun control. He said otherwise 48,000 people would be killed during Mr. Obama’s second term, not within the next year."

I predict roadway deaths will be closer to 100,000 not including all the other injuries. 

From CDC:

"More than 2.3 million adult drivers and passengers were treated in emergency departments as the result of being injured in motor vehicle crashes in 2009"]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[LTRs know that I do loving kindness on my bicycle. While I don't do this all the time, I do it as often as I can. 

My idea is to get hit, deliberately and to forgive the person immediately. I know that I am a few lifetimes away from this, but this is where I'm coming from.

Thus, I have been worried about the increasing (to me anyway)  negative tone in my blog. I tend to write quickly, five or ten minutes per post, and thus, I tend to use a lot of short hand. 

For example, when I write "motorist" I really mean, "people who happen to be behind the wheel of a car, but might be cyclists, or those who defend motoring to the detriment of all other people who can not afford to own or choose not to drive an automobile." 

This is pretty clunky and makes for confusing prose so I sum it all up in motorist.

However, I have recently, thanks to Ted and others, come upon the notion that cyclists are dividing themselves into smaller and smaller groups. Also, the whole motoring vs. cycling motoring duality is pretty stupid as most motorists have put a piece of steel between their legs a few times, and most of us cyclists have access and enjoy the benefits of motoring.

I try to keep thing in perspective, I can count the readers on one hand after a fireworks accident, but I do not want to come off as overly negative, accusatory, nor hostile.

The problem is the inner and outer problem. On one hand, we can pretend that things are OK and live in an imaginary happy place while our friends are getting run over and attacked while lax enforcement (not a typo) does nothing or even spends our tax dollars immunizing the criminals.

Also, I really love reading government published PDFs.

So the point of this post is to keep things in perspective. I don't hate everyone.  I want everyone to be happy. I realize that the road to happiness is both internal and external and it's going to be a painful road indeed, but we will get there.

As I told a co-worker today regarding transportation, I am highly optimistic that things are will be much, much better in the future.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Penal Code 417: Or Why is Our Legal System so Soft on Crime?</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Warning, in this post, I will talk about the law which will probably make me look stupid. You have been warned.

"I will crush you with my car." Haha, very funny, yes?

Kind of.

The thought of a large wheel rolling over my head and popping it like an over ripe water melon does make me laugh.

On the other hand, sometimes saying stuff like this is a breech of the law and as is my policy, I URGE READERS TO FOLLOW THEIR LOCAL LAWS AT ALL TIMES! 

Recently, I found this interesting law: 

http://www.shouselaw.com/brandishing-weapon-pc417.html#1

"In order to prove that you brandished a weapon under Penal Code 417 PC, the prosecutor must prove the following facts (otherwise known as “elements” of the crime):

    that you drew or exhibited a deadly weapon or firearm in the presence of another person,


    that either

        you did so in a rude, angry, or threatening manner, or


        you did so unlawfully in a fight or quarrel, and


    that you were not acting in self-defense or in the defense of another person at the time."

Come on. Every time a motorist shouts something stupid at a cyclist is not a crime is it? After all, this is a gun law, right? An automobile is not a deadly weapon is it?

Usually, no.

But in context, it could be:

"A deadly weapon is “any object, instrument, or weapon that is inherently deadly or dangerous or one that is used in such a way that it is capable of causing and likely to cause death or great bodily injury”.3 "Great bodily injury" is a significant or substantial physical injury.4

Deadly weapons do not include body parts, as deadly weapons are necessarily extrinsic to the human body.5

    Examples: Examples of everyday “innocent” objects that qualify as deadly weapons when used to harm another person include (but are not limited to):


        a pillow (which can be used to suffocate a person),


        a razor blade, and


        a dog (when trained to attack people)."

So if a deadly weapon could be a pillow, I feel it most certainly be considered to be an automobile.

So why are we doing so little about it?

I have a few guesses.

If you asked why it is not being addressed, you will get the answer that many of these threats are harmless which is false as LTRs know that being number one in the amount of deaths does not make something "harmless".

In other cases, this would be considered an "epidemic", and we'd throw more money at this problem.

The reason I can see this being ignored is that the Powers that Be can relate more to those tossing off the threats rather than those being threatened even though, again, this actually not true.

At any rate, those of us who think that "better laws" or "more enforcement", ONLY, is the answer to cycling nirvana, think about the existing laws that we have to "protect" us that are going totally ignored as the system is soft on crime when it comes to certain people and certain crimes.

Next time a politician says he will crack down on crime, ask him if he will enforce this law on all motorists, and you will see how soft (and small) he is. :)

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[In the video explaining this law the lawyer lists "self defense" as a  common defense for cases for persons accused of code 417.  If a driver was accused of breaking the law by threatening a cyclist with their vehicle, then "self defense"  seems like a poor defense because this would imply that they were threatened by the cyclist.  I know that you have recently written extensively about this kind of absurdity, so maybe my logic is flawed.  However, as a cyclist I often feel threatened by motor vehicles.  I thought you might appreciate this video a friend of mine made concerning cycling and self defense.

  <title>Does English Transmit Cyclephobia?</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[When you speak of infectious disease, we talk about vectors. I am wondering if the English language is a vector for hatred of cycling.

What does this mean, hatred of cycling or cyclephobia?

Here's a mental exercise: imagine fitness, thousands of dollars of saved money, safety, health, fun, no congestion, and free parking. 

All of these things are desirable, right?

Now imagine a bicycle as the means to achieving these things.

If you are are normal person, when you think bicycle, you think of all the happy times you rode a bicycle. Cycling, by itself, is mainly safe and fun--it takes billions of dollars in government spending to really make cycling suck.

But many Americans see bicycle and they think that it's a vast conspiracy to destroy their Way of Life. I kid you not.

When the UN mentioned the word "bicycles" (and health), many, many nutjobs in the United States glommed onto the one word bicycle, and they saw a sinister plot.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenda_21

"Activists, some of whom have been associated with the Tea Party movement by the The New York Times and The Huffington Post, have said that Agenda 21 is a conspiracy by the United Nations to deprive individuals of property rights."

But that's a few loons, let's ignore them. 

We can't:

"During the last decade, opposition to Agenda 21 has increased within the United States at the local, state, and federal levels. The Republican National Committee has adopted a resolution opposing Agenda 21, and the Republican Party platform stated that "We strongly reject the U.N. Agenda 21 as erosive of American sovereignty."[14][15] Several state and local governments have considered or passed motions and legislation opposing Agenda 21.[16][17][18][19][4][20] Alabama became the first state to prohibit government participation in Agenda 21, but Arizona rejected a similar bill."

Oh, snap!

These people are very, very powerful.

Cyclists are not only arrogant dare devils who break every law that there is in order to delay traffic by a few seconds, but now we are threatening the personal property of every American and even the soverty of the United States.

That's right, riding a bicycle is treason on the highest order.

This means that the Republican Party itself is smearing bicycle riding and other healthy and green forms of living.

What is Agenda 21 anyway?

"Agenda 21 is a non-binding, voluntarily implemented action plan of the United Nations with regard to sustainable development."

Note the key word here, non-binding. That means that we don't have to follow it. It means that it's a suggest.

So even if we suggest being more green, riding a bicycle, and so on, we are the devil.

Sounds like these people have very, very thin skin, are very, very frightened and not very bright.

To paraphrase Jack Nicholson in "Easy Rider": "that's what makes them dangerous."

Here are some more details of this insidious plot:

Section I: Social and Economic Dimensions

This section is directed toward combating poverty, especially in developing countries, changing consumption patterns, promoting health, achieving a more sustainable population, and sustainable settlement in decision making.

Section II: Conservation and Management of Resources for Development

Includes atmospheric protection, combating deforestation, protecting fragile environments, conservation of biological diversity (biodiversity), control of pollution and the management of biotechnology, and radioactive wastes.

Section III: Strengthening the Role of Major Groups

Includes the roles of children and youth, women, NGOs, local authorities, business and workers and strengthening the role of indigenous peoples, their communities, and farmers.

Section IV: Means of Implementation

Implementation includes science, technology transfer, education, international institutions and financial mechanisms.

Wow, it helps poor people, women, and indigenous peoples. 

It seeks to protect the environment as well as expand science. Sounds awful to me.

But here's the kicker: ITS NON-BINDING. That means that that we don't have to follow it. If you want to give up your sovereignty and property the resolution has to be binding.

The other funny thing is that this level of insane hatred toward the two wheel, peddle contraptions is unheard of in some non-English speaking countries. They think that Americans are really bizarre in their hatred of that which makes us healthy, rich, and happy.

The other strange thing is that though there are cycle haters, I almost solely see them online.

Most SD motorists are kind. During our one road trip, most motorists were kind as well. When I talk to people about cycling, I get an almost overwhelmingly positive response especially from younger people, those who will be running the world once the older cycling haters die.

So if you are a cycling hater, you are a dying breed.

I don't speak any other languages, but I would like to expand my research to other countries such as China. Do they hate cyclist there, too?

I seem to think that they like them in Japan. A few South American countries have built some amazing and innovative infrastructure.

The research continues.

Is English the vector for cyclephobia? We'll find out.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>People Who Drive Noisy, Dangerous Vehicles Complain About Healthy and Safe Cyclists</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[http://www.bayofplentytimes.co.nz/news/cyclists-criticised-for-posing-risk-cycling/1696409/

I feel as if my blog is turning into the Onion: http://www.theonion.com/.

Local woman Sandy Obese: "Even though my truck takes up the amount of space of over seven cyclists, it alarms me to see two of them riding together on a road. My truck is super massive, and though there are large roads that run parallel, I insist upon driving it down the quieter safer roads, I expect them to free of cyclists."

Sandy was last seen waiting for several minutes as a giant delivery truck was parked, completely blocking both travel lanes.

Local dude, George Entitled said, "So what if we kill a few hundred cyclists a year? If the cyclists chose not to be born then they would not have been hit by us. So it's really their fault." He went on to say, "True, I can't recall a single motorist nor pedestrian killed by a cyclist in my area, but they _feel_ more dangerous even if cyclists are statistically tens of thousands more likely to be killed by a car or to even kill themselves than to hurt anyone else. Plus, cyclists are so greedy. They want some special gold plated lanes."

George was last seen having a heart attack after stuffing his face, inside his Lexus, with low quality, substandard meat that he got from a drive thru. He was known for insisting that he never had to get out of his car ever, and that everything paved over and put at his level while in his car from the post office, to the restaurants, to even movies and church.

From the article: "Whenever road users break the law whether they be car drivers, cyclists, skateboarders or mobility scooter users they can all be prosecuted."

They added, "But really, you'd have to be crazy to prosecute a motorist as they are untouchable. You can't even mention the statistics with their level of carnage without being socially isolated and called a crazy person. But skateboards, oh yes, who has spent more than a few days on a skateboard, minding one's own business, without being constantly followed and questioned by the police no matter how far away one is from the civilization?"

A local resident said, "I think cyclists are putting themselves at risk and other road users at risk by their actions," he said. 

"Yes, I realize that I am inside a large automobile that could kill anyone at any time even those inside other vehicles, but I'd like to focus the conversation and blame solely on the cyclists for the duration of this conversation because I'm a good person, and I just know that those who choose to ride safer and more healthy vehicles are NOT good people. Besides, cyclists are losers and it's funny to watch them fall over especially if they get hurt really bad."

Before he backed over a small child then sped away, "Really bicycles are the menace and ought to be banned. Barring that we should at least be able to shoot them for fun. After all, they are bringing the danger to the roads."]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This quote, to me, sums up the punk ethic: good music, shitty ideas, worse politics.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lydon

For some reason, there's this toxic idea that "Government can't do anything right."

Unfortunately, there hasn't been any solution to government in creating and solving a great deal of problems.

Worse, this whole notion creates a complete sense of selfishness and lack of gratitude.

I recently realized this when I heard that a number of articulate and intelligent people think that we are getting screwed in our water bills.

That's total nonsense because we are getting handouts from Colorado and LA.

Thus, instead of feeling a sense of gratitude which is a happy and healthy feeling due to the facts, these people had an uneasy sense that they were being ripped off based upon the underlying beliefs that I spoke of above.

The same can be said of our transportation system. It's all subsidized at the federal level. We are NOT paying in what we are getting out--if we were we wouldn't be in debt.

The only people who are NOT getting much of anything from the government is the homeless. The police harass them; they seldom help. In fact, one time an officer bought a homeless person shoes and it was so strange it was a viral news story! Rob a bank and see how quickly the system will come after you. Defraud a few thousand homes and nothing will happen if you are "too big to fail."

The point is that the more you get from the government the more likely you are to hate and to be contemptuous of it.

Similarly, the car free cyclists, for the most part get nothing from the government, but we welcome anything that they might do, in the future, to make things safer for us. In contrast, the Quisling advocates who are totally motoring dependent, and thus get a healthy government ration of roads and parking are skeptical that the government will help us. 

I don't have any solution, but I am trying to purge myself of toxic ideas--all abstract ideas really--in order to try to see the world more as it really is.

There are a lot of bad things that the government has done over the years, but regarding our basic existence: food, water, electricity, and so on, we are doing very, very, very well, and I think that it's wholly patriotic and intelligent to have a strong sense of love and gratitude for our country.

Sure we should criticize the lame-ass agencies--hello NHTSA!--but at the same time we should acknowledge, with open eyes, the wonderful ways that a strong federal government with wise intervention can enhance our freedom by allowing us to have electric lights all the time and not when the "market" allows like Enron wanted. We are free to enjoy fresh and clean water from a tap instead of walking down the street for a few miles with buckets on our head.

Let's let go of juvenile punk fantasies and blind hatred and open ourselves to a little love and gratitude and courage to enjoy them.

  <title>Death By Dooring? House Speaker Howell Thinks It's Funny</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Note, that this is in the great state of Viginia, a state that I do not live, but I do have some friends warmly known as Rose and Orchid Bouquet do live there.

In a bold attempt to save some of his constiuants from death by dooring:

"Senate, J. Chapman “Chap” Petersen (D-Fairfax) has proposed banning people from opening a car door near moving traffic “until it is reasonably safe to do so.” The bill also would forbid a person from keeping the car door open “for longer than is reasonably necessary to load or unload passengers.”

Since dooring, while not the most common way of dying on a bicycle, kills several cyclists in the US, a year, and scares the shit out of hundreds of thousands of others, you'd think that this should be a serious penalty, right?

"The offense would be punishable by a fine of up to $100."

When I think of myself getting hit by a door, because someone is too lazy to look one second to see if I'm there, and because I'm hugging the door zone as to "not delay motorists due to my hobby" you'd think that this would matter to someone, right?

"House Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford), heading into his 26th General Assembly, 
<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/va-politics/some-quirky-proposals-part-of-va-legislative-sessions/2012/12/30/f74a8c40-50fd-11e2-950a-7863a013264b_story.html">chuckles at such legislation."</a>

Dead cyclists are a laugh a minute, I guess.

It would totally be unfair to say that Howell has no concern for us:

"Despite his amusement, Howell said he sympathizes with some of his fellow lawmakers.

“Sometimes, in their own mind, they think it’s a good bill,” he said. “There are ones that might sound a little wacky, but to a lot of people, they have some merit.”'

Yes, we're so sorry for the poor cyclist and those of us who show a little human concern for us.

I thought that the one of the "only things" that an extreme conservative felt the government should do is to protect its citizens. If spend billions going around the world to disarm, an actually unarmed tyrant who has a hypothetical, but never real nukes in order to "defend American lives" you'd think that they could protect us from the badly designed roads that the government built here. 

I guess they are too cheap, lazy, and now amused to do even that.

Thanks Howell, we love you and you're sense of humor.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[First of all, I there has been a huge impact on me due to meeting a few LTRs.
This is quite strange as there are only a very few of you.

On the other hand, the change was positive, IMHO. I feel that I should make, at least a little attempt to reduce the complaining on my blog. It's gotten pretty easy to blog by numbers where I'd read a government report, academic paper, newspaper article or other brain dead organization's write up on cycling and critique it.

Over the last year especially, I feel that this blog has honed my views on cycling: "speed kills, yield aggressively, infrastructure not blame, and so on."

One goal that I continue to hold is to be more mindful of my written, verbal, and mental speech. I posted about this before, but I do believe that we have two duties: to find out what sucks about our built environment and to be grateful for what we have all ready.

This morning, I was thinking about the whole notion of "rights to the road", again, and I think that one reason I'm so against this approach is because it precludes gratitude. A "right" sounds angry, demanding, and confrontational. Instead of having "rights" to the road perhaps we can have "gratitude for the road"?

How many of the motorists who post angry posts about cyclists just want a bit of gratitude. I have some. I would like to thank all of you have had taxes taken out to pay for cycling infrastructure that you never use. I am grateful that I'm not killed. I'm grateful to use the roads that were so expensive to build. I'm grateful to have a job. I'm grateful to be healthy enough to cycle daily as well as the freedom to live where I wish, work where I wish, to organize my life so that cycling is actually built into my day.

  <title>You Are Not Above the Fray Cycling</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Aside from VC DBs there is one form of cycling advocate who is even more annoying: those who feel that they are above the fray.

If you feel this way, take heart, you're not.

You're not better than anyone who feels passionately about spending hundreds of dollars on useless classes, reflective gear, and helmets only to ride your bicycle in smelly, noisy, and deadly high speed traffic.

You're not better than those of us who want to wear dresses and suits and to have flowers in our basket while we don't think or hear cars at all, but only see lovely people walking and riding past outdoor cafe's and plazas.

There's no "middle ground". 

If you aren't with the urban design and cycle chic crowd, you're with the VC DBs because the mess we have is the result of people following all the rules, being logical, and compromising, compromising, compromising. We have compromise our safety, our health, to make our surroundings hell. In exchange for our compromise, we have only gotten mockery from the media, and blame for our own deaths from the government and the police.

If you are above the fray, then you are really for the do nothing status quo. You don't have to go to a meeting, behind our backs, and argue for the squashing of infrastructure, you merely need to get our of the way while the few VC DBs do so. It only takes a single motorist posing in lycra clothing per city to crush all infrastructure especially since half of America has elected do nothing scardy cats while the other has elected cheap sadists.

Things are getting better, but at a snail's pace. If you think that things are awesome then you don't really belong in the conversation that talks about change unless you want to align yourself against it which again makes you a firm VC DB.

I don't have a ton of time to elaborate about all the details, but the main difference between the two camps is that one side talks about safety as if cycling were inherently dangerous while the other side talks about how to make one's trip more enjoyable by making one's surroundings better.

Taxing the public is a legitimate form of revenue. There's nothing inherently immoral about it, and if one thinks that this is not so then one should not really be part of conversation because there's no way to get from here to there without massive, massive suffering and if one is in favor of massive suffering, I don't want to know you.

The government owns the roads and it needs to build things in a way that benefits us all. There are some pretty clear cut ways of studying this, but safety can't be the driving force or we'll just get a more sterile and safer hell hole.

This is why those who think that self-driving cars are wrong. They are poised to create one of the dark alternate futures just as the electric car advocates are. Sure they mean well, but they will still continue the biggest, unelected appropriation of public space since the original wars of colonization in the US. 

If we don't understand that streets are for people and people and dangerous machinery do not make a nice ride then we are in the other camp. Which is fine.

But don't lie to yourself about it.

Be proud.

Be honest.

Be a VC douchebag.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the things that pisses me off, like no other is being accused of wishing for Utopia.

Utopia literally means no place because it was created as a perfect place that can not actually exist.

In the real world, I'm more interested in studying the small changes in the environment which will empower us to act as better humans.

Do we really need a better environment?

I think so, but I am totally confounded on selling this idea to the vast majority of fellow humans.

They believe in the Myth of True Evil which means that there are good people and bad people and the bad people need to be locked up. Nobody admits that they are bad, everyone likes to believe that their motives are good and if they are not, it was due to exceptional circumstances.  

I'm here to say that everyone you hate believes that either they did good or there is a really, really, good excuse for their behavior. In the vast majority of motorist's excuses, this turns out to be the environment even though, they would not recognize it as such.

The environment plays such a subtle role on us that talking about it is like try to explain to fish that they are in water. If they are told that they need water, they won't believe it. So take a fish out of water and if it dies then blame it for being a "bad" fish. Or you can stop fucking around with its emotions and give it the place it needs to thrive.

Similarly, motorists and cyclists need to be in a healthy place.

I could be wrong. There could be a way to reform all of humanity so that we reach the golden day where all people act sanely and rationally and motorists have visual centers which are far beyond the human norm and reflexes beyond the human norm as well as a knowledge of the law to rival an experienced law professor.

Or we could realize that this is an insane dream, much more costly than a little paint, a little metal, and lot less concrete that traffic calming will cost us.

And if we get really silly, with our experiment, we can take into account the TOTAL COST of any road building project from cradle to the graves of all those that it kills to the businesses and homes that it destroys and take a tiny bit of money to give it to someone who doesn't really care about AASHTO or even NACTO, but rather they have a very, very realistic view of how real humans in the real world interact with real infrastructure. We might find that his approach saves more lives, costs less, and gives us a result that we are all a bit more proud of.

  <title>Why I Favor Revoking the Gas Tax</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2013/01/16/why-i-favor-revoking-the-gas-tax/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently in VA, the government proposed to eliminate the gas tax.

http://blogs.roanoke.com/dancasey/2013/01/your-thoughts-on-mcdonnells-abolish-the-gas-tax-scheme/

This blog is in favor of it.

Why?

1. Contrary to popular belief, road users do NOT pay their own way. They pay part of it, but not all of it. The gas tax is one of the most confusing things when it comes to transportation funding.

Take away the gas tax and this belief should go away that "I paid a gas tax so I own the road."

2. The gas tax does not take into account the size of vehicles and thus it does not address wear and tear on the roads. I can have a fleet of small motorbikes on a road or a few trucks. The fleet, over time, will use more gas, but create less wear and tear on the roads. Add pedestrians and cyclists who pay the gas tax indirectly in the price of their good as it's passed along by shipping companies versus their almost non-existent wear and tear and you see that the picture is an even worse mess.

You don't charge those who use it for how much they use.

3. If the roads are good and motoring are good why do we want to penalize people who use them? There's the notion that the gas tax makes people drive less. Since gas is one of the lowest costs in a car, the total cost per mile goes DOWN THE MORE YOUR DRIVE. The gas tax does not change this equation and thus we lose nothing when changing this.

4. As per above, now all the costs of transporation come from the general fund. Since there's no ownership on the stupid "road tax" in people's minds, car owners and non-car owners are now on a level playing field when it comes to negotiations. Since so much money was all ready squandered on roads, we can justify spending more, in the future on cycling and public transportation.

If the money isn't there for roads, tough.

5. Since the "economy" hums along the cheaper that transportation is, we should make public transportation free, too. After all, motorists are not paying their way anymore so why should anyone else?

Through the years, VA over reached itself and will have huge problems when all the roads start to rot and it does the ability, anymore, to raise enough revenue to pay for it, due to it's bizarre fixed belief on taxes.

For cyclists this is OK because the system will slowly break down and we can all get back to walking around safely and mountain bicycling everywhere.

By the time that the bills get bad, we'll be in full triage mode and it will make sense to implement the final stages of Agenda 21 and to implement UN control over the fine state of VA. :)

Eliminating local revenue sources to pay for gold plated motorways is step one in our plan to dominate the world thus creating people who live longer, are happier, and don't have to listen to loud noises around dangerous machinery. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Some days I'm irritable, but today, I was on a happy cloud.

I'll let the better known bloggers fill you in on the details, but today our government said, "YES" to cycling. 

When the alpha apes smile on me, I have to smile back.

Also, have been exploring the feelings of maternal love. I'm not sure if it's the same for me as I'm not a woman, but I do have a healthy feeling of being loved, and I love it. I feel warm, fuzzy, safe, and happy. 

So during my morning commute, I didn't even get mad or scared by getting buzzed. I wasn't really sure if I did get buzzed as I didn't check. 

Great, great feeling, that.

Not to mention the great feeling that the actual physical sensation of cycling gave me.

Here's to many more years of wonderful experiences in cycling!]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Are Deadly Standards Worse Than Nothing At All? </title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2013/01/15/are-deadly-standards-worse-than-nothing-at-all/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[First off, I have to give credit to the one and only Ted Rogers who co-authors this blog due to no fault of his own:

http://bikinginla.wordpress.com/

(Thanks, Ted)

Second, let me make it clear that this blog is firmly in favor of standards. It's all firmly in favor of common sense as well as intelligent people. Remove one of those things and you can get a big mess which is what we got here:

http://www.sanluisobispo.com/2013/01/09/2351127/cyclists-hwy-1-north-of-cambria.html

"Bicyclists and others say the resurfaced roadway is too rough, uneven and unsafe, and that sweeping just moves the small rocks to the road shoulder, making it worse for cyclists who ride there."

Of course, a few dozen cyclists who actually ride on the roads are total morons, right? Why's that?

Because of the magic of standards! :)

"Caltrans staffers in San Luis Obisipo had already met Tuesday, Jan. 8, and concluded that “the roadwork meets Caltrans standards and is not hazardous for cyclists,” Shivers said in an email."

LTRs know that since motoring is one of the most deadly ways of getting around right up there with cycling and walking which are all dangerous due to poor road conditions, the standards must be a problem. 

After all, what's the alternative to standards? Mountain biking. Mountain bikers are much less likely to be killed or hospitalized compared with roadies despite the fact that mountain bikers take more chances on roads that do not meet Caltrans standards.

Thus, if the "standards" are worse than nothing at all, the standards are part of the problem.

Also, the whole idea of standards are ideas which should make things safer. But if things are not safe, we can't go back to standards to prove that they are safe as this is circular logic. In fact, if a road is unsafe, but up to standards then we must reject these standards all together and ask for roads being built to be safe.

I feel that Shivers should at least do a walk through of the road that he thinks is "safe". He better bring along some big goggles because I heard that cars are throwing stones at those huddled on the shoulder and probably some ear plugs. I'll be waiting for him to complete a fraction of what OSHA requires as basic safety auditing before reading from a piece of paper about useless standards which have created a transportation system which kills more people in certain age groups than any other cause.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>2030 San Diego RTP: A Super Bad Start</title>

After reading the first two lines of this the RTP, I'm all ready angry.

"Ask anyone what’s the biggest problem in San Diego, and you’ll probably hear “traffic.” "

I don't know anyone who would say this. But it just shows, that right out of the gate, they are 100% can centric and thus, this organization is fundamentally incapable of giving us a livable city.

In fact, many of the brightest and most product citizens of San Diego leave because it's so motor centric which makes it spread out. This is due to bad design. Their total inability to grasp this is telling.

"However, if we have learned anything in the last decade, it’s that we can’t build our way out of traffic congestion."

Um, I had posted earlier, but five minutes of google has shown that we have known this for decades. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smeed's_law

"He predicted that any intervention intended to speed traffic would only lead to more people driving at this 'tolerable' speed unless there were any other disincentives against doing so."

This law came out in 1949 and seems that--though the formula does not work 100% of the time, the general idea is blindingly obvious.

Yet, it took them decades to figure this out?

Finally, I do applaud the notion that "we can't build our way out of traffic congestion, but I'm skeptical that this is actually the case.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>2030 San Diego RTP: Big Promises Made And Broken</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/2030-san-diego-rtp-big-promises-made-and-broken/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[ http://www.sandag.org/index.asp?projectid=197&amp;fuseaction=projects.detail

"At the heart of MOBILITY 2030 is the Regional Transit Vision, a 21st century strategy to develop a seamless public transportation system for the region –one that is integrated with our growing communities and that ultimately is competitive with driving your car during rush hours."

And:

"Finally, Demand Management focuses on reducing trips on the
transportation system during peak periods and encouraging alternatives
to driving alone (e.g., transit, carpooling, vanpooling, biking,
and walking)."

Wow, that sounds awesome! How are they going to do this?

"Several highway improvements are currently under construction, including the I-5/I-805 merge widening, completion of State Route (SR) 56 between Interstates 5 and 15, SR 125 between Fletcher Parkway and SR 94, various widening projects on Interstates 5 and 15, and freeway-to-freeway interchange connecting ramps at I-5/SR 78, I-15/SR 56, and SR
94/SR 125."

So basically, they are going to make public transportation more appealing by attempting to reduce congestion via the means that in the previous post where they said that this won't work?

Plus, why would I ride the bus if the roads were nicer?

Also, we know that these dangerous merges kill people. I rode on Fletcher before and I had to salmon back to avoid illegally riding on a freeway. And they want to widen it? You'd think that they were like a wild animal who, after a taste of bicyclist blood, wants more.

If they know that widening roads does not work, why do it? And when are they going to repave the roads that they all ready built?

"When implemented, the improvements in MOBILITY 2030 will complete the region’s highway and roads network, and transform it into a robust system with more lanes dedicated to carpools and buses integrated with more than a dozen new high-quality regional transit services. The Plan includes a flexible roadway system which can be used by transit and high occupancy vehicles (HOVs), and improves goods movement through the region."

The mask is slipping. Note how they are starting to play bait and switch with words? More freeways is not compatible with public transportation and cycling. Sure you could drive a bus on a freeway, but this is not the same as building a decent public transportation network.

I think that they have no commitement to public transportation at all. Even when they are forced to create public transportation, they are able to siphon most of the money off for motoring.

The way we'll know if they are actually committed to public transportation is when they remove their parking lot and replace it with a park and they take all their trips to work on the trolley and bicycle.

But they won't because these things don't go everywhere, are too slow and are not reliable. If they were then congestion should not be such a problem.

But deep down that's all they care about. Despite the promising beginning where they discover Smeed's Law, the RTP is sprinkled with this nonsense:

"Transportation infrastructure and services must be coordinated with land use planning if we are to avoid increased traffic congestion, reduced mobility, and a deteriorating quality of life."

As a cyclist, my mobility and quality goes way, way up with increased congestion. I guess they don't ride bicycles so they don't know this.
We could have great public transportation as it's the only way that 100% of people can get around: handicapped, elderly, the young, and the poor. 

Rather than building subways everywhere and roads and parking later or not at all, they prioritize the most expensive, inefficient, and elite form of transportation.

To rub salt in our wounds, they tell us that they actually care about cycling and public transportation. 

I plan to read the entire plan.

Prepare to be underwhelmed by their plans for the next SEVENTEEN YEARS.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>2030 San Diego RTP: Integration Code for Freeways </title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I really like integration when it means not discriminating against people.

It sounds nice and sensible. However, this nice word has been repurposed to nefarious purposes.

LTRs probably know that racist VC DBs have taken the phrase "integration" to mean "playing in high speed traffic on a bicycle." Thus, they seek to give a dangerous and foolish activity to be equivalent to civil rights.

Now, the RTP is taking the same word as code to build more freeways:

"Integrating Transit and Roadways"

This phrase is used all over the RTP.

When I think of integrated public transportation, I see myself walking a block and not getting out of the Underground until I wind up in the middle of Balboa Park.

Since this entire document looks like it was written someone personality disorder. They want Smart Growth, but they build to encourage sprawl. They want more cycling, but they build to discourage it. And now they say they want "public transportation" but they steal the money for freeway motoring projects. Overall, I recommend that the authors be put in a mental hospital. :)

In the RTP, our friend "integration" means freeway projects:

"Competitive transit service must be able to operate in congestion-free lanes. The Plan includes an extensive network of Managed/HOV lanes on the highway system designed to accommodate transit services as well as carpools, vanpools, and fee-paying patrons (similar to I-15 FasTrakTM where fees fund transit services in the I-15 corridor). On arterials, the
Plan includes funding for transit priority treatments, and regional funding to help complete regionally significant arterials. The Plan also includes major transit capital projects, such as transitways, double tracking, direct access ramps, and grade separations, and provides operational funding for the expanded regional transit system."

Here's some more doublespeak:

"Systems Management helps get the most efficiency out of our existing system, makes travel services more
reliable, convenient, and safe, and reduces traffic delays caused by accidents and incidents."

Haha, more efficient? Motoring is the least efficient way to get around in terms of cost and least efficient in terms of space and least efficient in terms of dollars per mile. So it's a little insane to spend billions on more motoring and to claim efficiency. I just don't get it.

Also, reducing traffic delays will increase accidents not reduce them. You can't have it both ways. High speed motoring is responsible for the lion's share of transportation deaths. To make things safer, you want to increase congestion and reduce the travel speed of single occupancy vehicles. Also, faster cars burn more petrol. Finally, safe and reliable seeming transportation encourages people to live, work, and play in areas which are further away which increases exposure time to motoring which increases risk, encourages more petrol usage which is less efficient, and it encourages more motoring which equals more congestion.

  <title>Silly Study States the Obvious But Still Manages to Mislead</title>

Maybe they are equally to blame for the crashes, but if you have 2 cars crashing people will still get hurt.

If you have to bicycles crashing the cyclist will less likely be hurt.

If you have a car crash into a cyclist, the cyclist is hurt.

Thus, the addition of a car makes things dangerous and it's misleading to say that they are "equal" when one party brings almost 100% of the damage into the mix. 

This should be obvious.

Also, since most people drive and bicycle you would expect them to roughly make the same number of mistakes as in most cases, they are the same population. Duh! Thus it this finding is only insightful if we accept that cyclists are some kind of alien species.

From the article:

"It's so great to know that our crashes are not all random ... and there are things we can do to prevent crashes," he said.

I 100% disagree. This is because we all make mistakes. Also, you can ALWAYS point the finger at a motorist or cyclist if you frame the discussion that way. You find what you measure. I can ALWAYS find many mistakes I made which wound up being safe due to luck. If you have a series of people continually making mistakes, which is reality, crashes are random.

This is silly:

"The previously reported drop in the city's bike crash rate as the number of bikers has made drivers more aware of bikes has continued to hold."

So what? We have to be out there getting run over before we are safe. Ug. Who are these assholes?

Why not make things safer BEFORE the drivers kill a bunch of us? I guess because they are too cheapass to do so.

"The study found bike-motor vehicle crashes clustered on arterial streets where traffic concentrates. But it found that streets with bike lanes, such as Hennepin Avenue downtown or University Av. SE tended to have lower crash rates than streets like Lowry Avenue or 28th Street with only partial or no such markings."

Yes, this is true. I found this in all the data I looked at as well. Bike lanes save lives. Pretty obvious if you look at data.


"Cyclists are much more likely to ride in a predictable manner if they have a place to ride," said bike activist Ethan Fawley, president of the Minneapolis Bicycle Coalition."

This is tautology. Most cyclist collisions in SD that I have heard about had the cyclist behaving in a "predictable" manner. By this, I mean they were well trained and riding like they were supposed to be: legally and sensibly. They still got hit.

But by "predictable" in this tautological context means not getting hit. So most of the cyclists who did not get hit also did not get hit. 

"They give more assurance to those hesitant to bike on high-traffic routes like Portland and Park avenues, he said."

What!?

No they don't. These people who say this believe that they are some kind of super heros. They are really just lucky. Anyone can get hit by a car at any time on a high speed road. On such a road you are more likely to die. Cars literally "come out of nowhere" because the road camouflages those with black paint. Cars going at 50 MPH or more are only seconds away even if they are coming over the horizon. With roads which are 4 lanes are more and minimal intersections this gives you seconds to race across a dangerous road. This does not make me safe.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Do Bikes Mean Business?</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Sometimes, it gets lonely being a contrarian, but mostly it's just plain fun.

Still I don't wish to be contrary for the sake of being contrary. When I say something it's because I strongly believe in it. 

In this case, I feel that Bikes Mean Business, while true in many ways, is lazy and a self-destructive slogan.

http://www.bikesmeanbusiness.com/

Let's put some bread on a happy sandwich.

Riding a bicycle, to me, has provided numerous financial benefits. Thus, for me, bikes me very good business indeed.

Now the nitty gritty.

From the site:

"What truly drives economic activity? People are attracted to vibrant, lively public spaces. Study after study concludes that safe, walkable and bikable places are a high priority in attracting and retaining the desirable young professional class. Communities accessible to children, the elderly, families, pedestrians, cyclist, and automobiles are proven to be the kinds of places that attract more people. They have a bustling and welcoming street life and attract more visitors."

While I agree with everything here, I don't think that the paragraph really answers the question that it raised in the first sentence. People are indeed attracted to public spaces, but the cities were hollowed out and people drove to the malls even if this meant that their hometown's business would die and it would start to suck. This is because free parking also drives business.

See the problems is that while bikes can help with business, once we frame the discussion with "whatever helps business the most" then if it turns out, as it sometimes may, that cycling does not create the biggest economic activities.

Another example was the very nice chart that we showed congress people about how much people spend on bicycles. Guess what? They spend waaaay more on their cars. So it looks as if the most inefficient method is the best as far as being "good for business."

Here's another look at this concept:

http://www.bikeleague.org/conferences/summit13/

"In pure economic terms, bicycling pours billions of dollars into the U.S. economy, creating jobs and boosting community development from coast to coast."

But so do automobiles! In fact, we'd have more money for roads if we scrapped the "hobby cycling paths" and widened the freeways. 

I don't think that we should do this, but this is the conclusion that many will reach if we start with this broken premise.

Also, the notion of bringing intelligent people to a city is a sound one, but overall, any kind of economic development of this kind, if done in many places will be a zero sum game. That is, there are only so many bright people and only so much extra money. So this kind of thinking will not ultimately help out.

I can hear it now.

"OK, Mr. Smarty Pants," you say. "It's easy to tear things down. What is your alternative."

First of all, cycling development must be seen in two ways. First of all, is HARM MITIGATION. It's a common belief in even the most libertarian circles that "your rights end where mine begin." Killing someone is a huge curtailment of one's rights. Since motoring brings the danger, it must bring the solution to that danger. OWNING AND OPERATING DANGEROUS MACHINERY IS NOT THE SOLUTION TO THE DANGERS BROUGHT BY DANGEROUS MACHINERY!

This should be obvious, but it's not.

Thus, I see the case for the government building cycle tracks to mitigate the harm that they created, where there was none, by their initial road projects.

Second, is that roads and bicycles can not be seen as distinct from decent urban design. Overall, cycling infrastructure, when done right, fosters more efficient use of land which means cost savings. It also encourages keeping savings in a community instead of exporting money. Finally, it gives one a choice which means that cycle tracks expands our liberties by making cycling an option. Adding freedom is a good thing especially when it does not have to cost anything at all. The money for cycling is all ready allocated by the federal and state governments and it's up to the regions which want better development to spend it.

Let's spend a bit more time thinking of all the possible ways that we can promote bicycles instead of picking the easiest and laziest of choices. Otherwise, we might find our slogans being used against us.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Do Cars Mean Business?</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2013/01/24/do-cars-mean-business/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[LTRs know that like a diseased tick, once I get ahold of vein of controversy, I don't let go until I either get my fill of blood or squashed. :)

Going along with a previous post which questioned the brain damaged assertion that "Bikes Mean Business", I'm asking yet another question. Do cars mean business?

Of course they do, but do they mean very much business?

According to CAR, a leading pro-automobile think tank, the answer is, "CARS DON'T REALLY CONTRIBUTE TOO MUCH TO THE US ECONOMY." From their report:

"At the end of 2008, U.S. automotive output was 2.2% of GDP"

http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CEYQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oesa.org%2FDoc-Vault%2FIndustry-Information-Analysis%2FCAR-Economic-Significance-Report.pdf&amp;ei=WdP5UJocgt-IArycgdgM&amp;usg=AFQjCNHV_6gbA8igN1d_ZsbQ9plCdsfwGg&amp;sig2=1Zd3tUNE_yJPr8ToVMtjsg&amp;bvm=bv.41248874,d.cGE

Two percent isn't too much. Note that this isn't counting the enormous economic output that such a powerhouse is creating by taking tax dollars to build roads, paying doctors to treat hundreds of thousands of motoring injuries, paying for the obesity epidemic, and the burgeoning parking meter industry. I don't feel that we should think of extra misery and expense on American citizens to be "productive part of the GDP" and neither does CAR, apparently.

In fact, their report looks a bit desperate to act as if cars are actually really important rather than a part of our economy that continues to decline. Since 1995, we autos have gone from 3.7% to 2.2% of our entire GDP. I know that the economy was in the toilet, but this is a declining percentage of a smaller economy, a double decline. If auto manufacturing had stayed the same then it would have actually increased in percentage, but it went down.

Next, the CAR report tries a sad bait and switch as it tries to conflate auto manufacturing with manufacturing of everything else. 

"A look at the entire production and supply chain provides a rich narrative of how a strong automotive industry historically supports the growth and stability of many other industries, such as basic materials suppliers of steel, plastic, rubber and glass, which are used for making bodies, interiors and trim, tires, gaskets and windows."

This is typical extortion like we see from the banks. Do our bidding or we will bring the whole system down with us.

Next, they stress research and development which is only funded 1% by the US government. Do you know why? Because research and development funded by our government is there for public interest like curing cancer. What are some of the auto industries research goals?

"In 2007, the U.S. automotive sector, responding to: 1) the need to improve safety in vehicles, 2) consumer demands for new model types with enhanced cosmetic and drive performance characteristics, and 3) regulation of emissions, invested $16 billion into R&amp;D."

If you banned cars, we wouldn't have any of these problems. Thus the research done is mainly to get rid of the problems that cars cause in the first place. 

Next they whine about the "economy". 

"Several contributing factors are responsible for the current anemic economic situation, yet the primary culprit tends to be the American housing market and the risky operations that lead to its growth."

Guess where the housing bubble took place, primarily? The suburbs which were only possible by guess what? The automobile. So the auto industry is again whining about a problem that they were critical for its creation. Boy these guys are hilarious.

"This unprecedented sales activity was largely supported by: easy access to low interest credit (often through draws on home equity);
an ex-urban housing development movement necessitating increased vehicle ownership; a booming stock market; post- 9/11 manufacturer incentives; and an enhanced sense of personal wealth."

Who saved them? Hard work? Intelligence? Genetic superiority?

"In addition to the bankruptcy and restructuring activity during the summer of 2009, the U.S. Federal government also intervened in the U.S. auto sales market by introducing the Car Allowance Rebate System, commonly referred to as the Cash for Clunkers program. Congress appropriated $3 billion for this program; the impact on new vehicle sales proved to be immediate and significant."

Ah, so the US government made it possible to continue to sell cars to people who admitted above were only buying them because the only property they could afford was due to motoring which was caused by widespread motoring. My head is spinning.

Remember this next time we hear about "gold plated bike paths" or "cars are important to the economy."

From their own report, it seems that CARs understands that the US government is important for the buying and selling of cars.

Thus, we should not be ashamed when we ask the government to spend some change building infrastructure to fix the problems that they spent billions creating.

Thanks CARs.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>2030 San Diego RTP: An Illegal and Deceptive Proposal</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[http://www.sandag.org/index.asp?projectid=197&amp;fuseaction=projects.detail

"Transportation infrastructure and services must be coordinated with land use planning if we are to avoid increased traffic congestion, reduced mobility, and a deteriorating quality of life."

I must love the above sentence because I have all ready quoted it once before, but here we go again!

One of the laws that the RTP got sued for was that it did not do enough to reduce greenhouse gases.

"SAN DIEGO – Superior Court Judge Timothy Taylor ruled yesterday that the San Diego Association of Governments violated state law by failing to fully account for, and take steps to reduce, climate pollution in its environmental review of the region’s long-term transportation plan."

http://www.climateplan.org/californias-new-vision/around-the-state/san-diego/

In reality, it can only INCREASE traffic congestion; a focus on reducing congestion is the same as having a goal of increasing greenhouse gases.

Of course, they say that reduced congestion is equal to reduced greenhouse gases (because people's trips are faster) but LTRs know that based on Smeed's Law, this is not true. Make a product (motoring) more attractive by reducing congestion and people will do more of it.

"Systems Development: More Travel Choices"

This sounds great. We're going to get more networks, right? That is, the only complete network is for motoring. There is ample evidence to show that if we don't have a complete network,we won't have any choices. What are they doing to complete more networks?

I think that if they are serious about giving "choices" rather than just lying about them, they'll stop building any more motorways because that network is done. What does the RTP give us:

"The 2030 RTP includes a flexible roadway system, which can be used by transit and high occupancy vehicles (HOVs), and improves goods movement through the region."

Wow more roads. Nice.

There's no mention of trolley network nor a bicycle only network. Nor anything for pedestrian only network. The only "choice" they give us is pretty much the same network that's all ready done.

I'm leaving out many quotes where they mention the words: transit, pedestrian, and cycling because they don't talk about a network. No network, no choice.

Here's some more nonsense:

"Implementing the 2030 RTP requires close cooperation and coordination among all transportation agencies, local jurisdictions, and the traveling public."

Here's one blogger who thinks that the plan sucks and will not cooperate. Of course, I don't have a choice and as you know: THIS BLOG ALWAYS RECOMMENDS FULL COMPLIANCE OF THE LAW--NO EXCEPTIONS.

No, sir. I won't break the law, but if could legally not comply with this plan, I would do so. 

The notion that the public has to agree to this plan is just another lie. They don't care what we think.

Overall, this plan will do more to discourage transit use and cycling. Here's one reason:

"As seen in these two figures, levels of service (LOS) A through D indicate free-flow conditions, while LOS E and F indicate growing congestion, unstable flow, and stop-and-go traffic."

But as a cyclist, I WANT stop and go traffic because it's much, much safer. Plus, having stop and go traffic makes cycling more attractive which I thought was one of their goals.

In conclusion, when they say that they want cycling, transit, and walking, they plan for ways to discourage these activities. Even putting a bit more money into each of these activities will yield no change at all if they reduce congestion.

I suggest that they take out any mention of congestion reduction as this one goal makes all their other goals null and void. But they won't because safety of anyone but motorists as well as offering real choices through the creation of alternative networks is NOT on their agenda.

This plan is full of lies which are there to placate the cycling community. We are not stupid and won't be tricked by their continual use of the words cyclist while they do their all to make cycling more dangerous and less attractive as a mode of transportation.
.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Often, I have heard in certain circles that we are either not ready to debate a certain topic, such as helmets, or we are being too "harsh", for example what Copenhagenize calls "the bull in the China shop", the motor vehicle.

I'm, personally, really to argue all of it. As LTRs know, I like to argue as much as I like gossip.

Lately, I have finally had a word to describe what has happened to me in many debates. These debates occur when people whine that CM runs stop signs, that cycling is dangerous, that helmets save lives, that I should get the fuck off the road, or that I should ride in the middle of fast paced traffic as cyclists fare best when treated a drivers of vehicles.

I stand my ground, argue back and annihilate the other side's arguments very, very quickly.

Mostly the responses I have been getting is summed up with the term "RageQuit".

http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rage-quit

"RageQuit in one word is Internet slang commonly used to describe the act of suddenly quitting a game or chatroom after either an argument, extreme frustration, or loss of the game."

I really love it when people RageQuit. I have heard that when someone declares victory in an online debate it means that they have lost, but I don't think that this is so after everyone else has RageQuit.

Overall, I am very glad to have found a term to sum up my understanding of online (and real life) discussions.

I do think that it shows a real lack of character to give up so easily especially when I feel that I am open to slowly change my mind given the proper data.

I don't know if the past was different, but it seems that in this modern world, people think that their opinion is better than objective data which is collected by government agencies, scientists, and citizen data repositories such as what is found in the excellent BikingLa.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Intermediate Pictures</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/HumanTransit/~3/59fCl7sRlN0/driverless-cars-and-the-limitations-of-the-complete-imagined-future.html

One of the biggest stumbling blocks to advocacy is that there's a confusion between having a clear picture of intermediate change and that of slow changes.

I have stated before that I do believe in rapid improvements in infrastructure for cycling. Everywhere I studied had changes in the matter of a few years and dealt with blowback mainly by ignoring their wishes.

Aside from more or wider roads and freeways, however, I have had serious problems conveying the kind of intermediate state that we will be in before we become Copenhagen with palm tress. How will our high speed roads look? What will happen with on ramps to the freeway? We can't do it all at once.

Worse is that this has been a distinct character of modern America: that we don't think of our neighborhoods as organic and subject to change:

"Only in the America of the Suburban Experiment do we culturally expect that, once a home is built, the neighborhood around it should remain ever static. The traditional development pattern and the success of prior human settlements were based on the notion that neighborhoods, particularly those near the core the community, would continue to gain value and mature over time. "

http://bettercities.net/news-opinion/blogs/charles-marohn/19318/its-so-much-more-density

Thus no matter what happens things will change, but we must think in terms of shaping and adapting to changing conditions rather than remaining static.

When I read planning documents, I get a similar feeling that the writers believe that their children's lives are going to be very similar to their own with the same types of homes, desires, opportunities, and oil prices. Static existence is not the way of the modern world.

Still, as a society, we would really, really love to keep the status quo. Here's an article which highlights some of the reasons for this desire:

"However, this article  eloquently describes one source of uneasiness that has been growing in me for a while. I think I'd sum it up as follows, the status quo has grown too strong.

In today's world, HSBC can launder money for drug dealers and illegally do business with Iran and avoids prosecution because it could upset our economy. Yet, we throw people in prison by the boatload for possessing marijuana. Or worse, we throw Bradley Manning in prison for years before giving him a trial and threaten Aaron with decades in prison for downloading documents that were available to anyone at MIT."

http://petersen.io/posts/110

I suggest that we shouldn't limit our hopes and dreams to minor changes within the status quo. We should look to see where the world is headed then we can shape that world to that which benefits the most humans.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Cycling As a Symbol: Revisited</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Previously, I have written about how cycling is not a symbol:

http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2011/07/19/a-bicycle-is-not-a-symbol/

"I have seen a bicycle equated with liberalism, ecology, hipsterism, terrorism (no kidding), the United Nations, wealth, snobby elitism, theft of tax dollars, and even being white."

While I do not see a bicycle as a negative symbol, in my old age, I have changed my ways a little.

Not only that but I have talked to a bunch of tourers for whom a bicycle is a symbol.

I met them while going into a coffee shop. They were unlocking their bicycles and I mentioned that "parking was tight". Then I said that the only thing I like more than a bicycle is more bicycles. :)

They came to get a cup of coffee with me.

While we were talking, they mentioned that bicycles are potent symbols in their lives. Here are a few of their ideas.

For me a bicycle is a pile of money that I save in motoring, a great body, and lots of fun and friends. My social life revolves around cycling and cyclists. In fact, this has created an informal family for me. In fact, I'm going to explain this to the next comfort/away from personality type.

For Tiara, her bicycle means strength, power, and accomplishment. She especially likes to celebrate after climbing a hill. I found this to be inspiring.

For Derrick, a bicycle means escape, freedom, and karma. The latter meaning the good karma that one gets from having a lighter footprint.

Finally, for Derrik a bicycle is reality. This means of course that as a tourer, he wakes up each day and there's his bicycle. There is no other life that he lives, day by day and nor does he want to live another life.

For me, this was the best answer of them all and it sums up cycling for me.

Bicycle equals reality.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Most people know by now that I spend a lot of time on character development--social skills, personal challenges and so on.

For the rest of this week, I'm trying not to be negative.

I noticed that I had a larger than usual level of vitriol when I read a post by John Trees as well as the outrage about hunger in the world, erm I mean about a single parking spot removed in Brooklyn.

One of the self help talks I was listening to told me to make it a challenge to not say anything negative about myself or others. No self-deprecating jokes, no insults, or teases or anything negative.

This might just make me the most boring person ever! 

We'll see how long this lasts...]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Most days, when I pay attention to my emotions enough, I realize that my whole morning is an emotional roller coaster.

Riding in traffic, especially makes my mind go to negative places.

As I said before, I'm struggling with my own negativity, externally, for one week only.

So aside from reading the Regional Transporation Plan, emoting on making things truly equal for cyclists, and fawning over the gorgeous Dutch and Danish cycle tracks, I'm reading "Food For Thought."

http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/thai/lee/foodthought.html

"Thoughts are addictive, and especially when they're about things that are bad. We remember them long and think of them often. This is delusion, one of the camp-followers of unawareness."

Yes, they are. Even though my life is 100% perfect, and I'm living through my Golden Years, it seems that I horde negative thoughts so that I can enjoy ruminating over how unfair things are. This is a waste of time.

"Most of us tend to flow along in the direction of what's bad more than in the direction of what's good. When people try to convince us to do good, they have to give us lots of reasons, and even then we hardly budge. But if they try to talk us into doing bad, all they have to do is say one or two words and we're already running with them. This is why the Buddha said, "People are foolish. They like to feed on bad preoccupations."

There's more:

‘We don’t get to eat any meat’: This means that we gather up imaginary things to think about, but they don’t bring us any happiness. A person who opens his mouth to put food in it at least gets something to fill up his stomach, but a person who clambers around with his mouth open, craning his neck to swallow nothing but air: That’s really ridiculous. His stomach is empty, without the least little thing to give it weight. This stands for thoughts that have no truth to them. We keep searching them out, gathering them up and elaborating on them in various ways without getting any results out of them at all, aside from making ourselves restless and distracted. We never have any time to sit still in one place, and instead keep running and jumping around until the skin on our rears has no chance to make contact anywhere with a place to sit down."

For this week, instead of searching for negative things to think about it, it's going to be positive.

As much as possible. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[OK, enough soft posts!

I'm back better than ever!

I recently was sent a new Blog Post GeneratorTM. It's a VC site called: http://iamtraffic.org/2012/12/making-the-case-for-equality/#laws

Like Savvy CyclingTM, I really would like to see more cyclists on the road with or without infrastructure. 

Do we need infrastructure?

Yes. Like a person needs water. Sure he can get along for a while without it, but after a while, one will become more and more weak and angry hardening one's silly positions until one day one's claim to fame is not cycling itself, but for dividing the cycling community. [http://sports.groups.yahoo.com/group/chainguard/message/31366]

"It is correct that the term Vehicular Cycling has accumulated much bias, misunderstanding and negative emotion, and that it has divided those people interested in bicycle transportation."

When I am 80 years old, I want to ride on a cycle track or at least have some bike lanes in front of my house so I can ride my Mixte on it...Oh wait. :) [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step-through_frame#Mixte]

The (talking out of the corner of my mouth) unlike some people, I want ALL cyclist to succeed. However, I want their successes to be measurable in terms of greater people cycling as well as objective safety and not just rearranging words on a piece of paper.

The post (above) does not agree. 

The fall from the "Enforcement Myth."

Whenever there are clear problems that can easily be solved by infrastructure, we hear the notion that there must be better "Enforcement".

Part of this is "better laws."

"Many state vehicle codes include similar language, and in those states the language has caused great confusion, conflict, hardship, and expense for bicyclists."

I say nonsense.

BETTER LAWS WILL NEVER HELP CYCLISTS IF ALL THINGS REMAIN THE SAME.

Why?

POLICE ARE PRIMARILY MOTORISTS AND WILL _ALWAYS_ SERVE THE MOTORING INTERESTS.

This is as true in Denmark as it is in San Diego.

Thus better "enforcement" is going to equal open season on cyclists.

The most comical thing about this whole mess is that the "iamtraffic" page that talks about better bicycling laws freely admits that the police refuse to enforce the laws in ways that favor cycling at all.

"I had an unpleasant encounter with an Easthampton police officer, who did not acknowledge my legal right, as a cyclist, to use the road in the same manner as a motorist."

Great so the law was the only problem, right?

Wrong!

"The chief’s response was a non-sequiturial reference to city ordinance Section 3-41. The ordinance had no direct bearing on the conflict. The officer had never even accused me of violating it."

So the cyclist felt like she were in the legal right, but police chief did not agree! I don't see how rewriting the laws is going to solve this problem.

EVEN IF WE HAD A STRICT LIABILITY LAW POLICE OFFICERS AND THE "JUSTICE SYSTEM" WOULD NOT ENFORCE IT.

Thus, this is a total waste of time.

If the "iamtraffic" peope want to waste their time on this, well they seem to have nothing but time. Certainly riding their bicycles isn't taking up much of their time.

On the other hand, if they want to actually solve real world problems they'd look at places that succeeded and duplictate their success.

IF IAMTRAFFIC DOES NOT WANT TO HELP ORDINARY PEOPLE WHO DON'T GIVE TWO SHITS ABOUT THE "LAW" OR ANY OTHER NONSENSE TO RIDE BICYCLES THE VERY, VERY LEAST THAT THEY COULD DO IS TO STEP THE FUCK OUT OF THE WAY AND LET REAL WORLD EXPERTS SOLVE THE PROBLEM THAT THEY TRIED AND FAILED TO SOLVE FOR FOUR DECADES.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Dan, welcome to my blog!

Also, thanks for writing a complete blog post here! You are welcome as a guest blogger!

The point above was that given a text that one agrees with, in the original post the cyclist STILL HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE POLICE.

Did I say that the text itself was related? No, I did not. That was the point. The actual text of the law matters very little as it is only words on a page. We all interpret things very differently.

Look at how clear my post was to me, but you thought it was satire!

The same thing happens with the law. It's only words on paper until we interpret it. If you have police who hate cyclists, you will NEVER get justice no matter what the law says.

I have some basic troubles with the "E's", I think it's bullshit.

I am only for infrastructure. This will not change as I am "set in my ways." So don't waste your time trying to change my mind.

I am up for a spirited debate.

Finally, please read some of my more livelier posts such as Burning Ken's on My Lawn where I take the Father of VC to task for turning on his mentor.

Best wishes and welcome!]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Was this intended to be satire?  It sure reads that way.

It is clear that whoever wrote the above piece conflates three of the six Es.  Namely Equality, Enforcement and Education.  An enforcer's ability to enforce laws is only as good as the basic Equality or fairness of the law, and the quality of their Education about why the laws are equal and fair and safe bicyclists movements in traffic.

For example, when an enforcer engages in harassment based on a misunderstanding, ignorance, or even willful disregard of laws giving cyclists driver rights, that is not a problem with the legal text itself, it is one of how the enforcer is educated, and to imagine that we at I Am Traffic are not acutely aware of this is comically absurd.

The problems in the real world stem from various combinations of all six Es:

Equality (in law)
Education
Enforcement
Engineering
Encouragement
Evaluation

Without Equality in law, police can always with the full blessing of legislators, harass cyclists.  Thus equality is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for an equatable enforcement climate for cycling.

With equal laws, then one also needs to properly educate enforcers to understand not only the law, but the reasons why it is not only not unsafe, but actually desirable for cyclists to operate as drivers, to improve their safety and access to destinations on the road network.

Many enforcers in the real world simply apply existing discriminatory laws, such as FTR (far to right) laws as a simple way of always blaming cyclists for crashes, no matter who is at fault.  There's no need to consult a 3-foot passing law if the cyclists is "guilty" violating the FTR law, etc.  We seek to both remove the tools of discrimination, AND educate enforcers, since both are needed for effective enforcement.

For more please see the descriptions at http://www.iamtraffic.org

All the Es play together, and to try and stuff enforcer harassment problems into only one E shows that maybe the real experts are not who you think they are.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Anti-Roads Manifsesto</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2013/02/05/anti-roads-manifsesto/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[It's a manifesto because it's crazy. Normal movements have charters of position pieces or equally boring documents. On the other hand, the universe is crazy so crazy can map on to reality really well. :)

Every movement has to have a manifesto, and this is the first for the Anti-Roads movement in the United States.

 Here I will lay out the rationale for this movement and why not only it make sense in today's political, economic, and social climate, but why it's a shocker as to why this is not a prominent idea all ready.

I will lay out what Anti-Roads is not, but I will allow, as excercise to the pro-roads movement, to come up with reasons as to why we should build some particular roads.

First of all, I'd like to note that Anti-Roads is not actually against the transportation system as it is.

In fact, it's the empitomy of the status quo since if we build any _new_ roads this will be a change. In many ways the changes that roads create are radical ones.

Thus, in a strict sense, anti-roads is, at it's heart, a conservative movement. It should mesh with those who are afraid of change.

After all, we only have so many square feet of land on the surface of the Earth. In the future, this area will decrease all on its own due to the melting of the ice caps.

Thus, the anti-roads movement isn't about stopping all development, but rather it poses the question to what end is all this development leading.

For example, it's nice to have a road to the wood as well as a parking lot so we can drive there. However, if we cut down the entire forest and fill in all the lakes and rivers the whole point of the original road is lost.

Thus, it's not whether or not we have roads at all, but knowing when to stop. 

A painter does not hate painting nor his picture, but if he did not stop painting his art work would be a mess that the public could never enjoy.

Similarly, we should be careful to stop painting our world with roads after a certain point.

When?

I say right now.

Why now?

No reason really. I think that the real question is "why should we build or widen one more road?"

There are several bad answers to this question and I'll address some of them.

I won't go into detail on "congestion relief" because I have all ready blogged about Smeed's Law a million times. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smeed's_law]

Also, there's a well known relationship between traffic congestion and economic vibrancy. [http://transportblog.co.nz/tag/congestion/]

Thus, widening roads does not work in the long term and is thus a waste of money. Also, it actually sucks the economic vitality out of an area so it's actually killing the economy. Thus, these are very strong and fiscally prudent reasons not to build new roads.

A reason not to widen roads is safety. Wider roads are harder to cross for pedestrians and the faster traffic makes motoring and cycling more deadly. Thus, widening roads is a sure fire way to kill people. Thus, for national security reasons, widening roads is bad as motorist currently kill more Americans on our soil than rogue states, terrorists, child molestors, and serial killers combined. 

Another reason not to widen roads is increased greenhouse gases. The changes we are going to experience due to greenhouse gases are going to be very expensive, and perhaps even life threatening for humans. Thus, it's species suicide to widen roads and to create new roads. There are reports that widening roads _decrease_ greenhouse gases. These reports are false because they do not take into account increased motoring traffic that occurs when roads are widened nor do they take into account the greenhouse gases that are released when building and maintaining roads.

Another reason not to widen roads is that changing demographic demands will make our current infrastructure seem excessive. Less younger people are buying cars and those that do drive less. Also, due to the recent shifts in wealth due to the sub-prime crisis, there are an increasing number of people who are too poor to ever drive. Thus, though population is increasing, the population that could ever use the wider roads is decreasing. Thus, the notion of motoring roads is increasingly becoming class warfare where the wealthy minority makes mobility, a basic human right, to be difficult and dangerous. On town, Black Hawk, Colorodo even made the owning and operation of an automobile mandatory until the state struck this forced motoring down.

The last reason that we should not build new roads is because we have no money. Sure we have a large transportation budget, but we continue to forsake the current infrastructure and allow it to crumble while building new roads. Again, really, really fiscally irresponsible to do this as each new road becomes a permanent liability and thus tax increase forever.

There you have it, a sensible case for a simple, and common sense idea. 

Ironically, there is no major organization who has even considers this simple notion even the Tea Party which prides itself on shrinking the government. Nor can you find any large environmental group supporting this idea.

Finally, I'd like to say that the roads we have are good and should be improved especially to make them safer for non-motorized users. There are legitimate reasons for building new roads in the US, but these are beyond the scope of this document. I fully support the creation of new sensible and necessary infrastructure, but this building should not be done in a vacuum, but it should take the existing expenses into account, and it should be done with a plan for at least fifty years in advance.

That is, if we widen a road each decade, where will be in fifty years? In one hundred. 

As Loa Tzu said [http://mydescentintomadness.wordpress.com/2010/06/16/tao-te-ching-verse-9/]

"To keep on filling

is not as good as stopping.

Overfilled, the cupped hands drip.

Better stop short than fill to the brim.

Over sharpen the blade,

and the edge will soon blunt."

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Continuing along with my Blog Post Generator [
http://iamtraffic.org/2012/12/cyclingsavvy-works/]

We are going to continue to repeat ourselves ad nauseum.

"I don’t think many are claiming a trained cyclist is just as likely to crash as an untrained one."

I totally disagree. 

That is, (all caps for the skimmers) CYCLING SAVVY TRAINED CYCLISTS ARE AS LIKELY TO CRASH AS AN "UNTRAINED" (SIC) ONE. [Emphasis mine.]

"Do we take an ends-justify-the-means approach in which almost any strategy which encourages people to bike is deemed okay..."

YES! That's how ALL sales tactics work. Cycling advocacy is a sales job, in part, so when we are doing sales, we use sales techniques. For some reason the VC DBs keep me stating not only the obvious, but tautology itself.

"...or do we help each individual maximise their safety, comfort and competence through means which are as ethical as possible."

YES!

We can do both through infrastructure.

In fact, according to this blog, it is the One True Way. :)

"Certainly those are all worthy goals, but it has led proponents to take some liberties with science, and misled many people about what factors are important both in increasing the number of cyclists and improving safety."

So basically those of us who want infrastructure are liars? I beg to differ.

"They argue that increasing the numbers of cyclists will make cycling safer in spite of hazards created by some types of bicycle-specific infrastructure."

No, we argue that qualified American engineers are intelligent enough to build streets that are safer for cyclists than the streets are now.

We argue that the current built environment, in many places, is wholly unsuitable for cycling at all and that to recommend cycling in those places is irresponsible at best.

"Analysis of one study of a Danish bikeway found that the decrease in crash rate was less than would be predicted by Smeed’s Law.  To put it in a more direct light: the number of crashes went up more than it would have if there had been no bikeway."

Ug!

CRASHES DO NOT EQUAL DEATHS AND SERIOUS INJURIES. CRASHES ARE IRRELEVANT COMPARED WITH DEATHS AND SERIOUS INJURIES. THERE IS NO PROOF THAT WELL BUILT INFRASTRUCTURE INCREASES THE NUMBER OF DEATHS AND SERIOUS INJURIES.

"And even if safety in numbers through facilities does reduce the injury and fatality rates, if those same facilities actually cause some injuries and deaths, then we must question the ethics of such a strategy, especially if other strategies are available which would be less likely to cause harm."

This is called arguing the possibilities, and here we come to fall back position number one. They concede the very thing that they had been argued then they completely change the terms of debate so we can continue to argue far beyond common sense and reason.

"But if increases in cycling are due in large part to factors other than bikeways, then any reduction in the crash rate is indirectly due to those other factors, not to the bikeways, and if those bikeways cause or contribute to conflicts and crashes — which they do — then providing bikeways as means of increasing use and improving safety does not work and is in fact unethical."

But we don't build bikeways solely for safety. We build them to get more people cycling and because bikeways are more fun to ride on. They also make transportation more efficient for ALL modes. AKA SEC: safety, efficiency, and comfort. Note how these other two things are NEVER argued. It as is the VC crowd is deaf.

Also, if bikeways are a small part of safety, this does not mean that they put cyclists at risk. As long as they don't cause a great number of cyclists to die or get seriously injured then bikeways are acceptable by me.

"Aside from the debate about whether or not bikeways improve safety, the need for cyclist training is essential."

I totally disagree.

Cycling is actually not really that complicated. There's a video, online, of a toddler doing mountain biking. This is safe because there are no cars. Add speeding cars to the mix and this would be insane. The same is true for all levels of cycling. Unless we enhance our nervous systems with science fictional drugs or electronic implants, we hav no hope of spotting a black, fast moving car. They literally come out of nowhere and there's nothing to be done about this kind of thing.

"Florida emergency room data shows that two-thirds of adult bicyclist hospital admissions do not involve a collision with a motor vehicle."

Yes, and for every major race, you see some pretty bad collisions. These racers are the best cyclists in the WORLD. Whether or not you have a solo accident is based in a large part on experience (NOT TRAINING BUT HOURS RIDING), speed, terrain, and your comfort with risk. If you ride slow and carefully, alone, on good infrastructure, you are unlikely to have a serious accident.

"Crashes involving turning and crossing conflicts occur whether one is cycling on a cycle track, a bike lane, a sidepath, a sidewalk, or on a road with no special accommodation at all."

This sentence had me speechless because it showed a totally uneducated and uniformed understanding of what cycling infrastructure means. Good cycling infrastructure tasks into account these kinds of conflicts. It always shocks me as to how arrogant VC DBs are to think that nobody but them ever thought about these kinds of collisions.

"Training cyclists reduces their crash risk for all of these circumstances."

Again, all the "training" you need is this: ride slowly, yield aggressively, pick your routes to have less and slower traffic.

"I — and other proponents of bicycle driving — am often assumed to be against all types of bicyclist-oriented infrastructure."

That's the least of your problem. I also think that you have a spotty grasp on the English language since we common refer to "bicycle riding" there's no such thing as "bicycle driving". It does entertain me and my friends, however.

This will be continued as this is getting too long for the Internet. I'd have long stopped reading by now. :)

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[http://iamtraffic.org/2012/12/cyclingsavvy-works/

"CyclingSavvy was designed from the outset for the average adult who wishes to bike around his or her community at a comfortable and sociable speed; who prefers to avoid busy arterials but occasionally needs to use them for short distances to get to a destination or another quiet, low-volume street."

This is, of course, useless in most of San Diego where a ride of any distance is going to require one to ride through fast paced, high volume streets.

For the slower streets, most people can learn enough about street riding by doing a Tweed, Taco, or Sunday morning ride. A full blown class is NOT necessary for something as simple as riding a bicycle, which like I said can be done by a toddler.

"How CyclingSavvy Differs From Effective Cycling"

One thing I'd like to know is do the CyclingSavvy (sic) People feel that Effective Cycling sucks (say real fast three times). Inquiring minds want to know.

"Since the rules for vehicular movement are nearly universal, especially in North America, the similarities between CyclingSavvy and Effective Cycling are far more prominent than their differences."

I have no idea what "rules for vehicular movement" means. It sounds like they believe that there are some kind of universal laws for riding a "vehcicle" that have been discovered like the Laws Of Physics rather than semi-random humans trying to interact, usually at high speed, in an environment which was built without any kind of study for safety nor any particular concern for non-motorized traffic.

"So we control the lane so motorists don’t try to squeeze past in an unsafe manner, but then, if conditions allow, we move over and strategically allow motorists to pass at lower speed, or at locations where we get some extra width to work with."

While this makes sense, we must note here that this is TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THE DRIVER OF A MOTORIZED VEHICLE IS TAUGHT TO DO. THUS IT'S NICE TO SEE THAT CYCLING SAVVY UNDERSTANDS THAT BICYCLISTS SHOULD BE TREATED BY BICYCLISTS INSTEAD OF LIKE MOTORIZED VEHICLES. 

Yeah for common sense.

On the other hand, I never do what is stated above because I'm too afraid.

"One need only read the student stories on the CyclingSavvy website to see that speed is of little consequence in getting the average non-sport cyclist to be confident in traffic."

It's nice to be "confident", but this is a false confidence. CYCLING IN THE TRAVEL THE LANE ON A HIGH SPEED ROAD, IS VERY DANGEROUS. This is proven by looking at the five million a year rear endings that  motor vehicles get each year. This is quite a bit. Motor vehicles tend to be much faster than bicycles, but one of the things that make getting rear ended, in a car, is slow speed compared with traffic. This has been proven each year since the dawn of motoring and the crash data is available for anyone with an internet connection, a brain, and a single working finger.

"Forester in Effective Cycling and the League of American Bicyclists in their curricula tell cyclists to drive in the right wheel track when the lane is too narrow to share.  What we have found, and what has been confirmed by research done by Dan Gutierrez and Brian DeSousa in southern California, is that the right tire track can sometimes be the worst position, particularly on higher-speed, multi-lane arterials."

Again, if I were truly "driving my bicycle", I'd be in the middle of the lane at all times. This lesson treats cyclists like they differ from motorists. While I applaud this great leap to common sense, I am bewildered as to why these people continue to say stupid things like their bicycle should be considered a vehicle when this is meaningless if "vehicle" means should focus on minutia such as lane position that motorists have no concern about what so ever.

Also, Ken Cross' research says that you should ride on the right part of the shoulder which is not in the lane at all. In fact, he considered the travel lane to be the most dangerous place to ride on the road.

I have asked this question in numerous forums and I have yet to have gotten a response to why they are contradicting this point.

"...and yes, even the pedestrian-style dismount-and-use-the-crosswalk (not recommended for Florida and other states where motorists treat pedestrians poorly)."

Fantastic. Nice to see context considered. Also, this is an intelligent and safe way to cross a large street. Again, good job. However, all of this would be totally useless with proper infrastructure.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Oh, another thing is that please, for the love of all that's holy BE SPECIFIC in your criticism. If you disagree, precisely how? Please attack pdfs and other research links. I have done extensive research in bicycle safety. I have read much research from many cyclists and other researchers. One persons's experience is one person's opinion. Yes, saddle time is super important. But it's not enough. 

I don't need to take cyanide to know that it will kill me. I looked up the LD50 and that was enough to stop me from trying.

Finally, why is it a VC habit to compare me to a terrorist? The first VC person I met, ever, asked me if I had a bomb. This is perhaps one emotional reason why I think you are all insane. What a way to welcome a potential advocate to San Diego. 

Classy.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I don't have to prove anything.

My whole point was that Cycling Savvy was unproven.

This means that there is NO evidence which proves that it works. I'll post a study I'd like to see.

This is not an equal debate. I don't have to prove anything b/c I'm not CLAIMING anything. 

Cycling Savvy claims it's safe.

The press release says how. Are you suggesting that the site: iamtraffic.org is misinformation? For that I tend to agree with you.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[http://iamtraffic.org/2012/12/cyclingsavvy-works/

"Interchanges and complex intersections can be enormous barriers to cyclists, so teaching them how to handle them is critical for attaining full mobility in their communities."

Seeing as this is where the majority of cyclists in San Diego die, I suggest that people don't ride here at all.

The last thing I'd want is for many cyclists to come to the false conclusion that they are "comfortable" in these areas. This would reduce political pressure to actually fix these death traps and to discourage building new ones.

In fact, I feel that we were let down by the creators of cycling safety courses. If they spent as much time and attention to eliminating and mitigating dangerous merges rather than telling people that they can ride their bikes on them, many people might be alive in San Diego. Also, we would have been spared the pain the motorists are going through including an recent manslaughter charge. This is going to be very costly to the City of San Diego, and we could have saved this money by not building the merges to begin with.

I negotiate horrible merges daily. It sucks, and I would not recommend it to anyone.

"Our strategies for these features are very different from the League’s and Effective Cycling.  We focus on helping the student read how traffic flows through such features..."

The problem is that traffic actually is not "flowing". It's a bunch of people in cars bumbling around with various levels of attention, cluelessness, and hostility. 

"...show them how to minimize converging paths with motorists and help motorists flow around them smoothly."

Except that for over six hundred times in the United States, traffic failed to "flow around a cyclist smoothly" and instead crashed into them and killed them. Until we start realizing that motorists only have so much attention, we can't teach people how to ride with them safely.

"While we do spend a fair amount of time discussing problems that cyclists will encounter when using bike lanes (or cycle tracks or sidepaths), we do this in an objective manner devoid of politics and ideology."

Wrong!

Savvy Cycling is very much a political movement as it teaches that we can ride safely in places where this is objectively impossible. Savvy Cycling members are very much against cycle tracks and other pieces of infrastructure. Due to the way that traffic planning is set up in the United States, it's almost impossible to ride a bicycle in a non-political fashion because the entire system is against cycling and cyclists. There's no conspiracy against cyclists, but there is very much malignant indifference which has kept the number of cyclists who die the United States constant for years. 

Government agencies which are supposed to help with cycling safety favor, overwhelmingly, Bottom Up Solutions such as classes which they continue push for highly the spending of billions to create Top Down Hazaards.

"Some of the students themselves, after learning of those conflicts, then question the wisdom of providing such facilities."

They only do so because they have not been given the opportunity to try such facilities. This is because they are not an option. Cycling Savvy people like it this way and would like to keep things this way. This is by design and not by accident. You don't learn about facilities are by taking anti-facilities class.

You learn about facilities by experiencing them, talking to non-road warriors who use them, by researching their history, and by reading studies about them. Cycling Savvy does not encourage any of these behaviors which would add some balance to the debate and would be less political.

"John Forester was openly hostile to bike lanes and sidepaths in his curriculum.  The League has been fairly neutral in its curriculum, but very supportive of bike lanes in their advocacy.  Some League Cycling Instructors have been frustrated with the contradictions between promoting integrated cycling on the one hand, while promoting bike lanes and other separate facilities on the other."

I am very frustrated by this as well. This is why I am very much against education. I am very happy to read the last sentence above, however, because it is the first time that it has been admitted that education advocacy is in direct conflict with infrastructure advocacy something I have been banging on about for years.

"What motorists want most from cyclists is clear communication on our intentions."

This assumes that most motorists notice us. It just takes one mostorists who does not to end this entire discussion.

"Motorists appreciate clear communication, and going beyond the necessary signals and including ones of appreciation is one of the best forms of advocacy we can imagine."

Again, there's no single brained, monlithic "motorist". There's a bunch of clueless people behind the wheels of cars who are late and they see a bicycle as a tiny and unimportant impediment to them getting to where they want to go. I know this from taking to motorists and motoring myself. A few seconds after climbing into a car, my tolerance for cyclists who take up a travel lane goes toward zero. I have no interest in communicating with that cyclist, I just want her to get off the road and the FUCK OUT OF MY WAY. I don't give two shits about her stupid "rights to the road". Finally, I'm scared we will hit her and angry for her putting us in this moral hazaard by riding at all.

"Instead, we provide an experience out on the streets in real traffic."

I'm totally in favor of this. This is a very good idea.

"Perhaps this strategy — of leading people towards confidence and competence rather than providing facilities which make people feel safer without actually addressing the real conflicts — won’t get as many people on bicycles, or do so as quickly, but we can feel sure that we are supporting our principles rather than subverting them."

Why do they keep asserting that facilities won't address real conflicts when that's the whole point of facilities? Why do they think that all designers of facilities are idiots? Again, this is highly insulting to engineers both in the United States and abroad.

And yes, you won't get many people on bicycles. In fact, I have heard of cyclists who wasted their money on a class and they realized that cycling in the US sucks, and they decided not to do it again. Great job Cycling Savvy.

"But look at how bike lanes and cycle tracks affect people.  Some non-cyclists see them as taking away from “their” roads."

Yes, and these people are not in positions of power. Their opinions don't matter and in a week after a bike lane is put in most of them will go on whining about the next thing to come into their limited view.

"Or they see them as something they were forced to buy (by the government) and give to someone else."

It's a common principle that one person's rights begin where another one's end. If the government spends billions on making a place dangerous it just makes sense that they would spend a small part of that budget on MITIGATING THE HARM THAT THEY CREATED. Bike lanes are there to mititage governmet created harm. Again, I never get an answer on this because it makes too much sense and Cycling Savvy never answer any arguments that make too much sense. Instead they Rage Quit (see a future blog post near you).

"It becomes a turf war."

Yes, all social justice issues eventually break down to land use issues. Bike infrastructure takes up space and it is very much a turf war. So does riding VC except VC is less appealing, less efficient, and is more dangerous. The sooner we realize that ALL cyclists are fighting a protracted turf war, the better our advocacy for all styles of riding will become.

"You cannot convince me something works when every day I see it not working."

So the author rode her bike for years in the Netherlands? This is a one in a million kind of person. Every single person who lived in the Netherlands had a much more profound view of the issues associated with cycling than someone with fifty plus years in the United States who's mind is mostly gone from sniffing petrol fumes.

"CyclingSavvy encourages cooperation between road users."

I love this, and I agree. Very well put.  

"Yes, some motorists get upset seeing cyclists take such an assertive approach, but they eventually realize such cyclists are predictable and cooperative, and that they only need to adhere to the same rules they’ve been following when interacting with other motorists."

Sometimes. And sometimes they kill you and the system often lets them get away with this. Other times they buzz us or throw things at us. Or they bitch on forums. THERE IS NO MONOLITHIC MOTORIST.

"Those who think cyclists should naturally be antagonistic towards “cagers” might do well to realize that virtually all the new bicyclists we might invite will be coming from the motoring population."

Again, I totally agree. Love and cooperation is the way to go. Since we are on this topic, I'll let you know that most "cagers"/motorists/intelligent people want first class separated infrastructure. Those who are against cycling infrastructure feel that the government should not support cycling at all and that cyclists should "get the fuck off the road and onto the sidewalk." There are virually no motorists who actually would like Savvy Cycling at all. None.

So if we truly want to take the motorist into account, advocate for separated infrastructure.

"You cannot convince me something does not work when every day I see it working."

I agree. Until one gets rear ended and die. It happens once a month in San Diego. A class can not save them from a clueless motorist. This is fantasy.

Fight Savvy Cycling. 

Support scientific, peer reviewed research for safer and better cycling.

No cycling infrastructure, no cycling safety, and no cycling rights!

  <title>Multiple Personality Disorder Cycling Advocacy</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[LTRs can skip this one without missing anything. Here I rehash some old ideas.

Often people think that my ideas are radical or whatever, but what they don't realize is that often their own stances doom them to weaker or more inconsistent policies.

One example is where on one hand many advocacy agencies encourage the 6 E's which includes engineering and education. But if you buy into the myth of the educated cyclist who is virtually immune to injuries then engineering is less important. If you believe we can engineer our way to Cycling Nirvana (I do) then education won't be that useful at this point.

You can't have both views and have a coherent and strong position, too. At one point, it's going to be one or the other.

The same goes for safety. 

You can't advocate that "helmets save lives" (they don't), "you never know" (but I do), or "it's better than nothing" (usually a helmet is WORSE than nothing) and at the same time fight a mandatory helmet law.

As the Wash Cycle points out, some are discovering this super simple idea the hard way. [http://www.thewashcycle.com/2013/02/maryland-lawmaker-defends-mandatory-helmet-bill.html]

“It is really an awkward position and one that is difficult to explain because we are fully supportive of the use of helmets and encourage everyone who rides a bike to use one,” said Shane Farthing, executive director of the Washington Area Bicyclist Association. “We’re just not convinced that a mandatory helmet law is going to improve safety. In fact, we fear that it will undermine overall ridership by limiting the safety-in-numbers effect, [that it will] actually have the opposite impact.”

Super weak, guys!

Much better to say that a helmet is totally useless; the main thrust of helmet laws is motorists who don't really care about cyclists safety. They are too cheap to do anything useful so they put the SOLE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MOTORIST'S BEHAVIOR ON CYCLISTS. This is a totally unfair transfer of power and blame. It is wrong for the government to create dangerous conditions which discourage cyclists and then to add insult to injury by harassing cyclists by making them wear something which is as useless as it is degrading.

PRO-HELMET, MOTORING, ANTI-CYCLISTS WILL NEVER SUPPORT REAL SAFE CYCLING BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO CHEAP. There is nobody to offend. There's only the "public" which is all ready misinformed. 

"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says helmet use reduces head injuries by 80 percent."

As I stated earlier the CDC is full of shit. By the way "reduce head injuries by 80%" means nothing. Does it mean that of 100 helmetless people who get hurt in a bike crash, only 20 will be hurt if they wore helmets? Does it mean that 100 will still be injured, but each injury will be 80% less?

If I actually believed that helmets saved 80% of cyclist's lives, I might (just might) be for a mandatory helmet law. But I have never seen a real world example where this law has done anything but to suggest that cycling is dangerous and stupid.

I feel that the advocates who are for these absurd helmet laws really do believe that helmets help.

So, like I said a million times, it's OK to be in favor of dorky helmets and boring classes, but don't pretend that you can be for these and have a strong stand on why it is paramount for infrastructure to be built.

I feel like I wrote this post a million times, but I'm still reading silly things like this:

"An avid cyclist herself, McIntosh said she has been surprised at the opposition to the bill by bike groups."

Just search and replace helmet with "a totally useless insult":

"An avid cyclist herself, McIntosh said she has been surprised at the opposition to the bill which makes mandatory something which is totally useless and and insult by bike groups."

Update (fantastic testimony against the MHL):

  <title>Stop Saying "Share the Road"</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2013/02/14/stop-saying-share-the-road/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a sequel to "Please, please stop saying this". 

But a bit different.

I have said this before, but I'll repeat it, we need to stop saying "motorists need to share the road."

This is wrong on so many levels, but it's a really brilliant verbal phrase that has gotten just enough VC nonsense into the popular nonsense to stymie any real progress towards making cycling anything less than a black art that requires hundreds of dollars of safety classes, bright colors, and safety equipment.

For one, thing, motorists are stunned when I tell them I don't want to share the road with them, I want to be out of their way. This makes them feel good and builds instant rapport.

I'm no longer barking commands and demanding special rights. Rather I am acknowledging something that they have always felt but have been too brain jammed by "share the road" propaganda to say anything.

I ask them if they have heard that we can do better than watching some asshole in tight pants block traffic--oh I'm sorry, control the lane, while he "asserts his rights."

This also defeats the whole "you play in our world, you play by our laws" bullshit we hear ad nauseum as if shitty drivers did not exist.

We defeat the whole, "they don't get bike lanes until they fallow the laws" canard as well. We don't want the same road, the same laws, the same gas money bills.

See how far we came by tossing out a useless phrase. Useless unless you are a pretend biker who drives to meeting to "represent cyclists" by blocking any forward progress in building sensible infrastructure, that is.

This also defeats the whole, "if you cycle, you take your life into your own hands."

How does this work?

I kindly, but firmly keep reminding them that "I don't want to ride my bike on the road ever because it's dangerous and inconsiderate to motorists."

I let them know that I really don't care what people do to one another in their cars. All I want is for motorists to somehow--I don't care how--mitigate the obstructions that they have created by building freeways and high speed roads everywhere.

I don't give a shit about how much it costs or who it inconveniences. I don't want a committee to meet or to go in front of a consensus vote. We didn't do any of these things before we carved up San Diego with the freeway system. If we did we'd still have cows where there is the I-8 and cycling would be a hell of a lot more fun and safer.

I think it's pretty clear that I could get around San Diego quite fine without all the stupid motoring infrastructure that was built at great inconvenience to many citizens who are still not compensated fully for their loss as well as at great GOVERNMENT cost.

If they would just cut this expensive government program and give me a refund, I'll take my mountain bike and clippers and make a trail for myself.

Alternatively, they can do the above and MITIGATE THE DANGERS CREATED BY BUILDING ROADS.

The key word here people is MITIGATE NOT SHARE.

If you don't believe me then try it. Tell some people about "sharing the road" and see how they get angry at cyclists. Then tell others how you don't think cyclists should be allowed to block high speed roads at all and there's a really, really inexpensive solution to the problem: "for the price of a useless helmet we can have cycle tracks." They won't believe the latter, but they'd learn something and be a lot happier and that's what really counts in the end.

  <title>Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell Forces Motoring on Next Generation</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I have noticed that there's a type of mythology comparable to those made by the Greeks in the motoring world. Up there with the myths that roads create jobs, motorists pay their way via the gas tax, and motoring with small children makes them safe, is the myth that roads are built in response to demand rather than the opposite which is that roads create a demand of their own.

http://streetsblog.net/2013/01/16/va-gov-bob-mcdonnell-boots-bypass-opponent-from-state-transpo-board/

Bob McDonnell is there so prove to the world just how true the fact is that motoring is forced upon people. Though there are various examples of this, here's the latest.

"Two-thirds of public comments about the bypass were against it — and some local residents complained of being “blackballed” for expressing dissent."

But what does the "public" know?

Surely this road is needed, right?

Haha, so funny:

"This fall, a consultant hired by project opponents found major flaws in the data regional transportation authorities used to justify the bypass."

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_McDonnell

But at least the road is paid for by the gas tax right?

"On January 9, 2011, McDonnell proposed funding projects to address traffic congestion in Northern Virginia and Hampton roads by diverting 0.25% of the sales tax collected in those areas from the General Fund into the transportation fund. Legislation is required to implement McDonnell's proposal, and Democrats responded that the revenues were needed in the General Fund for schools and public safety and that the projected revenues were insufficient to make a difference on highway needs."

Wow, he's tossing children and the safety of the community under the SUV for his obsession with forcing a highway on many who don't want it and on everyone who cannot afford it.

This story can be told all around the country. 

But the next time someone claims that we are motoring by choice remember who's choice it is: the friends of those who stand to make the most money from expanding the motorways. 

The end result will be a poorer state, less money for education, more infrastructure which will eventually crumble and require even more money to be wasted, destroyed property values which results in a smaller tax base, and areas that are more difficult to navigate if you are not in a car.

Vote for McDonnell, wasting tax dollars to expand Big Government for the needs of motoring socialists. :)

There's those who talk about how these conservatives like to talk about freedom and then campaign against reproductive and lifestyle freedoms, but I don't see a contradiction.

Just like your choice of partner and choice of reproduction, big daddy McDowell knows best for how you should get around. It seems like his main purpose for public service is to spend as much money as possible telling other people how to live their lives.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Anonymous Trucking Representative: My Job is To Kill Cyclists</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Well not directly, but I am getting a little sick of seeing stories of "increased danger to cyclists." This is something very vague and statistical which presupposes that cyclists and pedestrian deaths are random anomalies.

Nothing can be further from the truth. The number of dead cyclists each year in a given road network is very, very similar from year to year given that minimal changes in the road network are made. Make the roads safer by building infrastructure and the deaths go down. Widen the roads or increase speed limits in other ways, and deaths go up.

Thus, by attempting to "reduce congestion" you are signing a cyclists death warrant. Simple as that. We don't know who these cyclists are going to be but this is just as if you decided to off a given number of cyclists by lottery. The exact same thing.

Here's a story from the UK:

http://www.bikebiz.com/news/read/raising-lorry-speed-limit-will-be-a-danger-to-cyclists/013990

"Likewise, the AA and Institute of Advanced Motorists claim that raising the speed limit from 40mph to 45mph or 50mph will prevent dangerous over-taking of slow lorries on rural roads."

This will kill people pure and simple.

"This would improve efficiency and reduce congestion, as the DfT suggests. It would also improve road safety, an issue on which academics have been unable to come up with firm evidence but on which the industry has no doubt."

It's actually dead simple to predict the number of dead cyclists given good crash stats. Take the number of cyclists hit by trucks in a given year. Subtract those who died, now multiply by eighth percent (0.80). This is the number of new dead cyclists each year. If it's great than one then this law is guaranteed to kill people.

I know that the Trucking Lobby and the AA are only "doing their job." But did they have to pick a job where they publicly come out in favor of policies which are guaranteed to kill people?

Finally, if overtaking is so dangerous, I'd advise motorists not to do it. By encouraging overtaking, one is also putting motorists at risk.

Here's my suggestion, a bottom up one for motorists, both voluntary and mandatory. Ban overtaking on rural roads. Put out a PFA telling motorists that they should leave half an hour to an hour early if they want to get some place on time--I do the same when I cycle. Encourage _patience_ in motorists and shame those who speed. Lower speed limits and ban more motorists that do speed (isn't it nice that this is actually an option in the UK as it's often not on the table in the US).

Problem solved. As for "congestion", I'd give tax subsidies for rails and higher taxes for trucking and let the "free market" deal with congestion.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Know Your Representatives: Dan</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[A legend in the California cycling world commented on my little blog yesterday making me feel really happy.

http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2013/02/05/the-myth-of-better-enforcement/

Dan, in 2013, is President of Cabo:

http://www.cabobike.org/about-us/board-of-directors/

One of the organizations which represent, you, as a cyclist, to the great state of California.

And he seems to be similar to the others in the VC crowd:

Here's a video of him since I can't find an online photo in less than 5 google minutes:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrJOurj61xk

1. Does not care for Dutch infrastructure, though he does not seem to know much about it:

Here's some of his posts:

http://www.cabobike.org/2009/11/08/problems-with-bike-lanes-striped-solid-to-the-intersection/

LTRs will know what his mistake as: NIH (not invented here).

Why bother with these silly diagrams when the solution has all ready been discovered, implemented, and successful:"

http://wiki.coe.neu.edu/groups/nl2011transpo/wiki/ba51e/15_Dutch_Intersection_Design.html

2. He seems to adhere to the "VC creed":

"A culture of segregated disempowerment dependent on paint and paths is artificially high in North America because of discriminatory traffic laws
and inferior road behaviors perpetuated across the continent over the last century."

Notice how he thinks that safer roads "disempower" cyclists? He also feels that he is superior to others as those of us who just want the dangers for cyclists that the government built to be mitigated are "inferior".

Finally, he tries to drum up civil rights fervor for basically a bunch of old white dudes who get off with mixing it up with high speed traffic with the word "discriminatory".

Sad.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Your Biases Are Showing</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[http://transportationnation.org/2013/01/11/chris-quinn-dont-talk-about-bike-lanes-at-dinner-parties/

“And one of the problems with bike lanes — and I’m generally a supporter of bike lanes –  but one of the problems with bike lanes has been not the concept of them, which I support, but the way the Department of Transportation has implemented them without consultation with communities and community boards. “

Nobody told Chris, apparantly, that the word "but" was useless when talking to others because people automatically negate anything you say before it.

Not only that, but did Chris note that we were NOT consulted before they built roads in front of our houses?

I don't mind pedestrians nor cyclists at all because they make little noise, but cars are fucking LOUD especially when they roll by at late hours. When was I personally asked to veto anyone's ability to motor by my house? Not that I would ban motoring all together: how are people going to pick me up to take me to the hot springs? But I didn't even get a vote on the matter. Why not?

Probably because it would be too difficult to get a consensus on every tiny change in the streets. Also, many people would choose to have big wide roads in front of OTHER PEOPLE's home while closing the road right in front of their own so their children could play in the street. We'd have a hodge podge of disconnected streets where you'd have to teleport your car to get from one place to another which would mirror our current state of bicycle infrastructure. I wonder how Chris would like a place where he only can drive for a few blocks before getting out and pushing his car for a while. Probably not much.

Would it be rude to tell people that they can't moan about their extra time spent trying to secure a large parking spot for their truck?

Why are bikes such a horrible social faux pas?

“That’s a problem particularly in a community like Chelsea, where there is such interest in bike lanes but then you just create tension. It’s also a problem for example in Lew Fidler’s district in Brooklyn, where I’d say the jury’s mixed about bike lanes.  They were okay with the idea of the bike lane, they just wanted it moved one block over."

Yeah, and I want people to drive only a few blocks away from my house. Otherwise I'm OK with that.

But no talking about cars at my parties. Otherwise, I'll think badly of you. (Not really, just playing devil's advocate. I'm not actually going to micro-manage my guest's speech as that would be rude.)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Another Idiot Study Examined</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[LTRs know that I really love data and I think that we should do as many studies as possible on cycling. I am in the process of preparing some studies myself actually, though since I have no funding, we won't do them. But I'll make them available for people to see what a good study looks like.

Here's a shitty study. I wanted to thank the washcycle website and it is well done both as a blog post generator and as a resource for information. I'm extremely grateful for this high quality site. I don't want people to think that I am mocking the washcycle. I'm not. I am mocking a study that they posted:

http://www.thewashcycle.com/2013/02/bicycle-crash-study-2010-2012.html

"The information obtained from TARAS contained a ...total of 754 locations involving bicycles crashes. Since the total numbers were a broad amount, a narrowed list was selected based on the locations with a higher crash occurrence."

Overall, the idea of looking for intersections is a good one.

OK, all ready this report is starting to piss me off:

"Performing this Report led to a prioritization of which locations needed improvements in the District of Columbia. It is clear after reading each Detailed Narrative of the PD-10 Forms, Field 179, a very high percentage of the crashes were a result of an inadequate behavior of the pedestrians, bicyclists, and drivers. This concludes human behavior was the main crash contribution factor when those crashes occurred."

Since we all agree that deliberately stepping out in front of a speeding car, running a red light, or running into someone is all "inadequate human behavior" would this make almost all collisions, BY DEFINITION, due to inadequate behavior. What is the other cause? All I can think of is some kind of road or mechanical defect. So we are defining things a certain way then wondering why we keep matching up with what we just defined. This is tautological and that these researchers can be PAID to do such shoddy work breaks my heart.

The question is WHY were they inattentive? Why do they need to be attentive. Can't I take a fucking walk without always being attentive? People like to wander and not think too hard all the god damned time. So this is a pretty harsh, totalitarian system. PAY ATTENTION OR WE WILL KILL YOU.

I'm absolutely horrified that we care about pedestrian inattention.

Pedestrians walk in front of my bicycle all the time. Do I get mad? No? I am prepared to stop at any time. The person could be a child or a confused elderly person. To say that these people are inattentive ignores some basic realities of the human species and dehumanizes the most vulnerable people. This whole paper is a vast system to mitigate the blame, as much as possible from dangerous motorists who drive way too fast. It also excuses poor design which mixes pedestrians with high speed traffic then blames the pedestrian for NOT PAYING ATTENTION.

But this paper is starting to go from bad to worse. 

They actually suggest "additional signage" to prevent future collisions. WTF?

Next huge mistake is that they seem to be OK with shitty facilities if there's any drugs or alcohol. They also have no changes for FREEWAY RAMPS. What?! These are the objectively most dangerous places for pedestrians and cyclists. This paper is aggravating.

Finally, on page 13, we get a small whiff or reason: "there was no consistent pattern." 

YES!!

If you look at crash data enough, there usually is no real pattern. People get hit from all directions. The crash rates are pretty much spread out in all categories. There's no one huge category that dominates all the rest. There are just too many ways to die and humans seem to have embraced them all.

Here's another plan this paper has. No joke. "Implementation of brochures" 

I move to fire these stupid, stupid people. They have not a single clue about safety. This paper was a total waste of money and they are a waste of space.

I wish in the future, if they did a traffic study, they would have a way of testing actual improvements rather than make stupid remarks and even dumbed and wasteful "solutions."

PEOPLE WILL NEVER PAY ATTENTION ALL THE TIME. THAT'S NOT HOW THE HUMAN MIND WORKS. IF YOU MEDITATE FOR FIVE MINUTES, YOU'LL FIND YOU MIND WANDER A FEW HUNDRED TIMES. IMAGINE TRYING TO DRIVE FOR A FEW HOURS IN A WARM CAR WITH A RADIO ON WHILE STARING AT THE SAME ROAD. THE WHOLE NOTION OF AWARENESS IGNORES BASIC FACTS ABOUT THE HUMAN MIND.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>iamtraffic Encouraging "Lawful" Cycling Or Why I Stay Off the Road</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Blog post generator iamtraffic.com once again gives me the giggles:

http://iamtraffic.org/2012/12/the-enforcement-of-imaginary-laws/

Once again, they fail to understand that there are two kinds of laws, those on the books and those which are actually enforced. Anyone who has basic reading comprehension can see that these two types of laws only have a passing resemblance to one another. 

It was in my late 20's that I realized that if I continued to whine about the "letter of the law", I'd become an old, unlikable curmudgeon!

Instead, I turned to a life of humor as well as analyzing what laws are actually enforced and following them.

Not that this blog is advocating for breaking any laws. CYCLING UNBOUND SEZ, ALWAYS FOLLOW EVERY SINGLE LOCAL LAW. ALWAYS. (My legal team can be such buzz kills sometimes). :)

Anyway, over and above laws which are on the books, if the police enforce a law, then it's illegal. For the thick: ACTIONS THAT GET ONE ARRESTED AND CONVICTED IN COURT ARE ILLEGAL; IT MATTERS NOT IF YOU CAN FIND THESE LAWS ON THE BOOKS OR NOT.

For years, I have been urging my readers to stay off the road and not to play in traffic and you'll be safe. I urged those who were on really dangerous roads to ride on the sidewalk, slowly, and to walk your bicycle around pedestrians. These are not legal things, sometimes it's illegal to ride on the sidewalk, it depends upon your location. Still, outside of a big downtown, I have never gotten into any trouble with police while riding on the sidewalk. This is much more different than riding on the street where many people have trouble, and I have been (rarely) buzzed and harassed.

So I ask you, who do you want to be? A wise and invisible ninja cyclist who doesn't get run over, is ignored by the authorities, and makes the motorists happy, or an idiot who actually believes these fools from iamtraffic (sic--you're not) and gets into all sorts of legal trouble.

As the Clash said, "Give 'em enough rope." Thanks for giving me another argument against: VC, Savvy, whatever you call it this week cycling.

Who cares what it's called clearly they teach unlawful cycling.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>United State Crash Data 2010: More Myth Busting</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I analyzed the data from here:

http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811659.pdf

I have found that there are many myths about cycling accidents that keep getting repeated over and over again.

First I'd like to turn the reader's attention to page 138. I know we cyclists only get a couple of pages, I wonder if that's a good thing (few problems) or a bad one (getting ignored again).

Anyway, on this page, one can see that the largest number of accidents occured at 3 PM to 6 PM. One of the myths is that most accidents occur in the "dark of night" and thus cyclists try to reassure themselves that they are "safe" because they rarely ride at night and have big lights. Only about a quarter of the fatalities occured at night while about 7% of the injuries happend at this time.

Page 140 is chock full of myth busters:

First of all, like I give in my advice for top three safety tips, failure to lead is 28% of fatalities. This backs up my advice: "yield aggressively even if you have the 'right', don't take it." Note, I was not at these accidents so we don't know that if following any of my advice could have helped. In many cases, I doubt that the cyclist could have done anything--sometimes we are just unlucky to live in a place with such shitty infrastructure.

Only 10% were on either alcohol, drugs, or both which means that 90% of our fatal accidents had sober cyclists. Not that riding drunk is "safer" but riding sober isn't anything to brag about especially if you lord it over those of us who actually like a beer a few hours before we sober up and ride home. (God legal team, stop it!) :)

Only 9.4% of fatalities were those who failed to obey a traffic lights, signal or officer. Next time you think those running stop signs deserve to die, remember that 90% of those who were hit were observing these laws. Let's law the whole "scofflaw cyclist who deserved it" myth to rest.  And note, that since it's know that a killer will lie and lie to protect themselves and that many officers write down the words of a killer (if he's in a car) verbatim as if they are the God's given truth, I doubt that this number is as high as it seems.

Wrong way riders were only 7.2% of fatalities. This really breaks the whole "wrong way riding is deadly" myth since 95% of those dead were riding in the right direction. (They count wrong way riding and wrong side of the road differently which is strange so I added them up.)

Only 3.7% "improperly crossed the intersection" which again shows that it's a myth that most cyclists who die are incompetent.

Only 8% didn't have lights or wore dark clothing. This is really stupid that they even count this as there is not yet a government mandated clothing law for cyclists. We still live in a free country when choosing what we wear be it on a bicycle, in our car, or in church. So it seems a bit totalitarian to even care about this. Also, most motor vehicles have lights which should illuminate anyone no matter what they wear so I think that lights and clothes should be irrelevant. Finally, no street lights? Really cheap ass infrastructure seems to be the real problem to me. (Again no lights were counted twice and I added them up for my purposes.)

Erratic behavior and many other kinds of bad cycling are a very small number of deaths. Overall, it seems like the cyclists were more often NOT breaking one of their shitty violations than they were.

So next time people say that cyclists are "always running stop signs" point out that they almost never kill people when they do so and they are not even putting themselves at risk as only about 70 or so cyclists IN ALL OF THE US die a year for doing so. Furthermore, if they assert that "motorists always follow the law" point out that 33,000 LAWFUL MOTORISTS die and about 2 million LAWFUL MOTORISTS are injured each year.

Scofflaw cycling is safer than lawful motoring.

  <title>Malicious Anti-Cycling Laws or Cycling Bullying Part II</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2013/02/26/malicious-anti-cycling-laws-or-cycling-bullying-part-ii/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[A hearty thanks to one of my blog post generators BikingInLA:

http://bikinginla.wordpress.com/

Previously, I looked into possible causes of cycling bullying:

http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2012/05/29/cycling-bullying-possible-motivations/

Also, I have mentioned the notion of malicious compliance which is the idea of someone following the letter of the law to the point of absurdity in order to punish someone. The example was given was for Sandag and Caltrans bragging that they were "within the standards" even though, if they cared to perform a basic walk through along the side of the road, they'd notice that the roads totally suck for cycling and pedestrians.

Now, I'm combining it all together to mention some more ways that motorists, usually in their sick revenge fantasies, will try to punish cyclists. Often the punishment comes in the form of "fairness" or "safety". Though at this point, it's getting to where they just want to appease motorists.

Giving in to this is a form of revenge which in my mind is due to the extreme bullying mentality that some motorists have towards to the more vulerable and less fortuante. Thus, these people should be ashamed of their vindictive and selfish behavior.

The first example, is the old saw, registering bicycles. In San Diego and other parts of the US, this useless law was never enforced. The main purpose was to stop bicycle theft which if you know the attitude that our law enforcement comes to bicycles is laughable. The other reason is that they could catch the cyclists, if they commited a crime. I can't imagine a crime in which police on cars, helicopters, and even bicycles or god forbid, foot, could a police officer not catch up with an offending cyclist. In fact, if this is a great concern, it would make suspect the whole notion of motoring as it is the perfect get away car. In fact, that's why they call it a "get away CAR".

I'm not advocating banning cars, but I'm just saying that this idea does not add up.

The second idea is for cyclists to pass some kind of competency test and to carry a little car, presumably with a cute little bicycle on it. As I have blogged earlier, I'm in favor of this law as it would make the state pay way more attention to cyclists. Also, we'd have a seat at the table to demand infrastructure everywhere.

Seems like a lot of people Down Under agree:

http://www.news.com.au/national/bike-ride-licensing-a-battle-of-swerves/story-fndo4ckr-1226584208850

However, I would not seriously advocate for such a law, and I don't think that this is a solution to any known problem. Also, it would make it harder for people to get into cycling. Finally, the law makes no sense. A child can not operate a motor vehicle and this is reflected by the lack of a license available. However, even a toddler can safely ride a non-motorized machine such as a tricycle, big wheel, or even a bicycle. Should children not be allowed to bicycle with their parents?

Obviously, this law is not well thought out because it prohibits children from riding their bicycles even with their parents.

It's also kind of silly because we can't even stop people with no license from driving motor vehicles:

http://www.timesheraldonline.com/ci_22658040/grieving-dad-crusades-tougher-laws-against-unlicensed-drivers

I'll just mention in passing that the mandatory helmet law is yet another unreasonable demand placed on cyclists by motorists (and by some cyclists who don't do their homework).

Also there's the law that flat out admits that it's there just to appease motorists:

http://www.outsideonline.com/news-from-the-field/WA-Lawmakers-Propose-Bicycle-Tax.html

"According to the Seattle Times, the package would place a $25 sales fee on bikes worth $500 or more, a move projected to raise $1 million over 10 years."

http://streetsblog.net/2013/02/21/washington-state-considering-a-symbolic-tax-on-bicycles/

"In the past, some Oregon bike advocates have supported such proposals, under the notion that it would help allay the perception — no matter how inaccurate — that cyclists don’t pay for roads."

To this, I say this DON'T TRY TO SUCK UP TO MOTORISTS! IF THEY LIKE YOU, THEY DON'T NEED TO BULLY YOU WITH POINTLESS LAWS. IF THEY DON'T LIKE YOU THEY WILL _NEVER_ LIKE YOU NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU BEAT YOURSELVES UP. PLUS THERE IS NO MOTORIST VS. CYCLIST DIVIDE.

We all have friends and family who bicycle and motor--save for those small number of people who's social circle is extremely limited. Many motorists want to cycle, and making cyclists seem inferior is not the way to help them.

To even think of making these kinds of laws is due to an aversion to cycling. If people really cared about cyclists, they'd build the dedicated infrastructure that other places have enjoyed ever since bicycles existed.

Instead we get a series of behaviors which map on to bullying in other areas such as the workplace:

http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201105/the-silent-epidemic-workplace-bullying

"Bullies often involve others using many tactics such as blaming for errors, unreasonable work demands, insults, putdowns, stealing credit, threatening job loss, and discounting accomplishments."


1. Blaming for errors: Notice how the cyclist is always blamed for accidents in police reports? "You are taking your life in your own hands." "If you ride on this road, it's only a matter of time before you are a victim."

2. unreasonable (work) demands: This is noted above: licensing, helmets, etc.

3. insults, putdowns: Cyclists are elitists, little Christs of the road, road lice, etc.

4. stealing credit/discounting accomplishments: "I'm sick of how cyclists always brag about how environmentally friendly they are."

5. threatening (job) loss: Such as the town that banned cycling "for their own good."

  <title>Malicious Anti-Cycling Laws or Cycling Bullying Part III</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[It's funny how comparing a workplace to the motorway has been such a useful too for me to pin point areas which I thought were wrong. Behaviors which are seen as socially acceptable (to motorists only) on the roads are revealed to show underlying tendencies for bullying.

I want to make things clear that I don't believe that there are "motorists" nor "cyclists" as permanent being as most cyclists own and operate motor vehicles. The vast majority of us cyclists have active driver's licenses whether or not we want them as the default identification for the US requires minimal knowledge of and profiency of a motor vehicle. Thus, if there's a strange species of a hard core cyclist (who uses her passport for ID, I guess) then this is a very rare one. So when I say cyclist, you can search and replace with "motorist who happens to be riding a bicycle at the time". I just don't type this every time because it's too much typing.

While researching my last article I found this one:

Identifying a Toxic Workplace (aka Toxic Road):

http://www.kickbully.com/toxic.html

"Does your company confront aggressive people about inappropriate behaviors?"

Note how many police officers routinely fail to find a way to charge a motorist who has killed a cyclist? Definitely contributes to a toxic motorway.

"On the other hand, do they turn a blind eye to bullying?"

Notice how many states will even fail to pass a three foot passing law, something that will make some kinds of bullying allowed. Also, notice how many police officers do anything at all when people complain of an aggressive motorist. They wait till the situation escalates then fall over backwards to excuse the motorist.

"Even if you aren’t directly bullied, the fumes may get you. You may even conclude that finding a new job is the only viable solution."

And it's true that one of the number one reason that people don't ride bicycles is because of the toxic motorway.

"The dominant culture of your workplace has a huge impact on your ability to effectively deal with a workplace bully. Don’t even think about fighting a bully until you get a handle on the larger environment."

I totally concur. 

Here's an example where the motor way bully is protected:

"Tire slashing suspect held on $270,000 bail"

http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/local&amp;id=8636051

I do NOT agree with tire slashing. THIS BLOG MAKES IT CLEAR THAT I IN NO WAY CONDONE COMMITTING ANY CRIME AS DEFINED BY THE LOCAL LAWS AND CUSTOMS IN YOUR JURISDICTION. (Thanks Legal Unbound). 

However, these are comparable situations. While motorists who have "sun in their eyes" walk, someone who fights back will be dealt with swiftly by the law. Not that a quarter million dollars is protecting a machine while little is done to protect human lives. Not hard to see who's dominant in the eyes of the law.

Let's deal with signs of toxicity:

1. "Widespread anger and frustration" aka Road Rage.

2. "Workplace bully is admired." You only need to turn on a television commercial or watch a movie to see that cyclists are mocked while motoring is a sign of success.

3. "Scapegoats are always blamed" aka blame bicyclists first (BBF). There are whole papers dedicated to promoting this point of view as it sells classes (http://iamtraffic.org/) and it makes infrastructure look less necessary: http://www.metroplanorlando.com/files/view/bicyclist-crash-study.pdf.

4. "Dysfunctional processes: In a toxic company, processes tend to be dysfunctional, particularly if a workplace bully helps create them. In this situation, company procedures don’t make sense, making it difficult to get things done." 

Notice how it's confusing when to ride on the road, the sidewalk, etc. Note how many people have gotten tickets for not putting down their foot at a stop sign or riding too far to the right. 

"In order to create the impression that personnel issues are being addressed, upper management sets up a committee to investigate specific problems and suggest solutions. But the results are based on the premise that the employees aren’t very sophisticated and can be easily appeased. Input from employees is discounted or ignored and clueless managers rely on their own misapprehensions. Because the process is dysfunctional, the results are meaningless."

This has happened many, many times.

"Since they must ignore the impact of bullying on morale, they instead turn to “creative” ideas. Perhaps they find some popular solution to “make employees feel better about themselves.” This could include a patronizing “Extra Special Person” award, meaningless interdepartmental competitions or irrelevant offsite training seminars..."

This is what results in brochures, "motorist education", "cycling awareness", yellow safety vests, and mandatory helmet laws.

"By pushing a meaningless, ineffective solution to morale, employees feel they are being treated like children, or as second-class citizens. Morale deteriorates even further, and high employee turnover is often the result." 

That is people stop riding bicycles.

5. "Dysfunctional relationships: How do employees relate to one another at your company? In a toxic workplace, everyone seems to struggle with relationships. Misunderstandings are common, leading to frustration, anger and inefficiency. Gossip and criticism are the norm, and cliques lead to favoritism and feuding.

Noticeably absent in a toxic workplace are clear and straightforward conversations. You rarely see a quick resolution of relationship issues, and bad feelings may linger for months, or even years."

Note how often you hear things like "cyclists are ALWAYS running stop signs. And so on. We never see any resolution to problems of motorists attacking (either on purpose or due to malignant negligence) cyclists resolved with something that would actually work.

6. "Dysfunctional meetings: Do meetings at your company feel like a waste of time? Are they dominated by dull monologues and meaningless reports? Do they provide workplace bullies a forum to rant, rave and manipulate? Are reasonable people intimidated into silence?

In a toxic workplace, those who dominate meetings seem to prefer to discuss vague platitudes instead of underlying problems. They focus on theory rather than dealing with reality. By ignoring the real problems facing the company, they fail to accomplish anything of substance. The main impact of meetings is the loss of productive time from your day.

Bully is allowed to dominate meetings: A workplace bully tends to dominate meetings through his aggressive conversational style, including giving monologues, arguing, criticizing, interrupting and raising his voice."

Hello Vehicular (Savvy) Cyclists. Hello people who bitch about Agenda 21 at planning meetings and silence people with the chants of "USA USA" as if George Washington drove a Hummer.

" He uses generalizations, innuendo and presuppositions without being challenged. He stifles open discussions and prevents any progress, except to further his own agenda. He may even use a meeting to embarrass, ridicule and humiliate his opponents.

In a toxic workplace, any complaints about the bully’s domination of meetings will likely fall upon deaf ears. In fact, his aggressive tactics are more likely to be admired by upper management."

7. "Obvious hypocrisy in the company

A toxic workplace nearly always includes widespread hypocrisy. Executives are unlikely to acknowledge the serious problems plaguing their company, instead promoting the fiction of a healthy work environment run by enlightened management."

This is very true if you read Sandag's regional transportation plan. 

"Management fads

Executives in a toxic company often overcompensate by adopting faddish management approaches, as if propaganda is an effective tool to overcome reality. The result may be aggressively promoted company values that don’t seem to match day-to-day events."

Helmets, yellow vests, sharrows, and share the road signs.

"Clueless or evil management: Even when the hypocrisy seems obvious to everyone, upper management seems unaware of the contradictions between what is said and what is done. Maybe they want you to guess whether they are hopelessly unaware or utterly lacking in integrity."

This is evident, again in Sandag's RTP where they state that they want "more people on bicycles" but do almost nothing to make that a realistic choice.

8. "Overly restrictive systems for controlling people

A workplace bully usually thrives by controlling others. He prefers a workplace with dehumanizing systems, offering him more opportunities to tightly control their behavior."

I covered this before when people want more tickets, licenses, and other restrictions for cyclists.

"Companies fall into this mode of operation by designing and implementing overly detailed operational systems. These include overly detailed policies, procedures and job descriptions and performance evaluations."

Hello vehicular cycling as well as overly restrictive code such ASHTO's Green Book which is used to prevent meaningful infrastructure from being built.

There's a lot more and almost all of it applies so I suggest that one read the orignal article. I can only say a hearty "YES!"]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This is the UK edition of Cycling Unbound. Long story, but I am watching a lot of UK TV, etc.

If you have stories like this one:

http://money.uk.msn.com/save-money/how-to-pay-less-tax

"These 10 legal loopholes could reduce your yearly tax bill by thousands of pounds."

Yes! Save on tax money.

Sounds good right? Isn't saving on taxes a good thing? Would you EVER criticize someone for using legal loop holes to save money?

I think not.

That's why, again and again, cyclists, by running with the narrative created by motorists, shoot ourselves in the face.

Here's the deal. Whenever someone talks about how my life is good, I don't disagree. That would be foolish. People love to see people who are different suffer. Many people laugh at cyclists getting hurt because they feel like we are doing something dangerous and deserve it.

When the clip-on is on the other foot, I don't fight it.

That is, when people whine that we don't pay road tax, I agree.

It's the eleventh way to save on taxes.

Legally. 

What can be wrong with that?

So please, stop things like this:

http://ipayroadtax.com/

"Road tax doesn't exist. It's car tax, a tax on cars and other vehicles, not a tax on roads or a fee to use them. Motorists do not pay directly for the roads. Roads are paid for via general and local taxation."

Zzz...

No, try this on for size: 

"No, I don't pay the road tax, baby, you pay that for me. I'm not any more a free rider than the anyone else who saves money on taxes.

What, you don't take _any_ deductions on taxes, but, instead, insist on paying the full amount? If you are so generous with your money, you don't mind footing the bill for me, do you?"

See, dominate these assholes. Don't try to placate with facts and suck up to their paradigm. Saving money on taxes is good. Cycling saves money on taxes therefore cycling is good.

Easy.

‘Irresponsible’ cyclists should pay road tax, say quarter of drivers'

http://metro.co.uk/2011/11/20/irresponsible-cyclists-should-pay-road-tax-say-quarter-of-drivers-in-confused-com-study-226041/

So if you save any money on taxes at all, don't whine that I save even more money.

Stop trying to placate motorists with facts and start shoving your costs savings in their faces. :)

  <title>Paying Our Way</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The whole notion that motorists pay their own way is a lie.

This law is based on nonsense.

If motorists had to pay their own way, here are some other ideas to make things more "fair".

1. No free parking. Anywhere. Motorists either buy spots or they pay market price for their space.

2. All houses along the freeway routes get yearly payouts for noise and air pollution they suffer.

3. Asthma sufferers get payouts that are subsidized by increased taxes on motorists.

4. Motorists are taxed for all the non-motoring deaths that they cause. This money goes into a general fund which pays a life insurance policy for all those non-motorists that they main or kill to their families for their market value (annual salary) until 65 to the families. Note there are thousands of families each year that are terrorized by motorists whom currently get off the hook.

5. New cars must have doors that go up (to avoid dooring) and air bags on the outside in order to protect those they may "accidentally" maim or kill.

6. The gas tax is raised until it pays for 100% of all the roads where pedestrians and cyclists are not allowed to go on.

7. Calculations are run by how much motorists have stolen from the general fund for the last 50 years and annual registrations fees are increased to pay back what they owe.

If we make things truly fair, then motor vehicles will be the toys of the very rich just like they were before the MASSIVE public subsidies.

Let's get real when we discuss these things. Cyclists contribute a lot to society, but due to the bully attitude, we ALWAYS go unacknowledged.

Lets' stand up for honesty in this discussion instead of buying into the maliciously bad accounting behind this law.

  <title>NHTSA Exclusive: Review of Studies on Pedestrian and Bicyclist Safety, 1991-2007 Part I</title>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, I discovered another document by my favorite organization the NHTSA:

www.nhtsa.gov/staticfiles/nti/pdf/811614.pdf

Despite my negative views on this organization, I will try to be objective while reading this new study.

"Laws and enforcement. Research shows that many traffic laws regulating the interaction
among drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians are ignored regularly. Some laws may not be known or
understood. Others may be ignored because they appear unnecessary. Enforcement is sporadic
and ineffective in improving behavior."

Wow, this is highly accurate, and I am impressed.

"The most obvious need is to establish a strategy regarding these laws and their
enforcement. One possibility is to accept the current situation and recognize that these laws
describe ideal behavior but will not be obeyed regularly. This strategy accepts that laws and
enforcement have little role in improving pedestrian and bicycle safety."

I totally agree. I'm shocked that this organization is proposing such a sensible solution.

"A second possibility is to attempt to raise traffic law compliance substantially by
pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists alike."

All ready, we are starting to go bad. I know I'm a cycling blog, but we have to admit that it's tough to blame slow moving, relatively harmless human beings, who have been stripped of their natural birthright to walk in a straight line of "causing" an accident. We realize that they have the most to lose and pedestrians should be the most taken care of. Conversely, since cars are killing all of this, this basic fact should acknowledge how we prioritize enforcement.

"To do this, the laws must be generally accepted as
sensible and reasonable. The appropriate first step is to review all traffic laws applying to
pedestrians and bicyclists and all laws applying to drivers when they interact with pedestrians
and bicyclists. If the laws are not sensible and reasonable, they should be changed. Only then can
enforcement, combined with education, hope to be effective."

Yes, I hope that they do this.

"Public information and education. Pedestrian and bicycle safety education is absolutely
essential for children."

Great, here we are with the common refrain which seeks to blame the victim and let the driver off the hook. 

I suggest that we idiot proof things for motorists so they are less likely to hit people and make things safer for pedestrians so children can play in the street again. If this is NOT the goal than like they admitted above, I am not on board with this. Let's act like compassionate adults and be personally responsible for protecting our children rather than blaming them for their lack of education which will invariably happen once we put these education programs in place.

I have a school in front of my house and their "education" and "safety" program consists of having children blow whistles and yell at other children for not respecting motorists enough.

Conversely, there's such a fake system of safety around the schools that teaches the children to walk into the street without looking at all. I fear for this children when they have to cross a normal street.

I do think that children should be taught that cars can kill, yield aggressively, and take responsibility for your own safety, but this is more of a five minute chat rather than a complex Traffic Safety Course. There's really not a lot to learn about how to walk that a child can't figure out on her own. We need to stop over-complicating things.

"Facilities and infrastructure. Extensive research has been conducted on facilities used
by pedestrians and bicyclists. As this research continues, it should seek methods to accommodate
and balance the sometimes conflicting needs and desires of pedestrians, bicyclists, and vehicle
drivers."

Yes, I love facilities. Build more. However, I don't see the point in treating us all like specific species with "conflicting" needs. Except for "hobby drivers", most people are driving to destinations. Making things bikable and walkable makes destinations better for all of us. I'm sick of people acting like there's this war going on when it's really just self-centered people in the moment. When they are in a different mode aka walking to their car, nobody--except a character in a Ballard novel--wants to get run over. So there's no conflict here.

"Alcohol. Epidemiological studies have shown that many pedestrians and bicyclists in
crashes are impaired by alcohol."

This is fucking stupid. What do they want drunk people to do, drive? Or do they think we can sleep at bars. If the NHTSA seriously thinks that drunk pedestrians are worth a moment's time, they are too stupid to live. This is clear victim blaming. Plus, in cycling literature, NOT being drunk is linked to death more often than being drunk. Clearly being sober does not make you more likely to get into an accident. At the same time, we must refrain from circular logic. If you don't want people to drink. Fine. But stats seem to point to alcohol not begin a huge risk factor for non-motorized deaths. 

People are more likely to walk instead of drive when they drink and this ought to be encouraged. That is unless NHTSA wants to bring back prohibition.

"Conspicuity. Research on technical aspects of pedestrian and bicycle conspicuity –
driver visual capabilities, recognition distances under different lighting conditions, retro-
reflective materials, pedestrian and bicyclist awareness of their actual visibility, and the like – is
quite extensive."

Fuck you NHTSA, if you think that pedestrians have to wear shiny vests to take a fucking walk. Who are these assholes?

And WHAT ABOUT BLACK AND GRAY CARS? I CAN'T SEE THEM AND WHEN THEY ARE DOING 50 MPH, THEY LITERALLY COME OUT OF NO WHERE. WHY NOTHING ABOUT CAR COLORS? THAT'S BECAUSE THIS IS A BULLSHIT ORGANIZATION THAT'S ALL ABOUT VICTIM BLAMING.

"Older pedestrians. As the United States population ages, many aspects of society are
being designed to accommodate older people. Pedestrian (and, in some instances, bicycle)
facilities and programs should do the same. Some needs are obvious: longer WALK cycles to
cross a street; public education directed at older people. Others may not be. Research on all
pedestrian areas should keep the older pedestrian firmly in mind."

Again, nothing about getting elderly people out of their cars. Sigh.

"Bicycle helmets. Research has demonstrated conclusively that bicycle helmets
substantially reduce head injuries in crashes. The important issue is how to convince more bicyclists to wear helmets."

No! the issue is to convince more people that bicyclists die of high impact collisions with automobiles and HELMETS DO NOTHING FOR US IN THESE COMMON CASES.

"Research should continue to evaluate the effects of helmet use laws in
the United States and around the world. Research also should continue to evaluate the
effectiveness of various helmet use promotion programs. Research may be useful to develop more sophisticated methods of marketing helmet use to different cyclist audiences."

Here we go again. Same music. Basically, they are now equating helmet law "effectiveness" with how many helmets do they get on our heads rather than how many people are hurt on bicycles DIVIDED by total number of cyclists. 

It's almost like they know that helmets are useless and they are gaming the system to avoid testing their hypothesis....]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA["In standard law (as codified in the UVC),
a pedestrian has the right-of-way when in a crosswalk but the driver is not required to yield to a
pedestrian waiting to enter a crosswalk."

I feel that this is a bad law and a recipe for disaster.

Let me also state, that personally, I walk Ninja Style TM, which means that I assume that motorists can not see me. So I am always the one yielding unless I am sure that the motorist has stopped and saw me. This is still risky, but must take some risks or I'd be standing at the first cross walk, ever.

Incidentally, I _resent_ having to put my life into other people's hands when I try to walk around. I blame such toothless organizations such as the NHTSA, with their lame pap for keeping the pedestrian and cycling deaths consistently high.

Next, I'd like to talk about the section on children. I thought that this section was particularly cruel. Long time readers know that I think that the we should give children far more freedom by making things safer, over all, for them. Slowing or removing cars from local streets is one of the ways which can save thousands of families, a year, the misery of death or hospitalization of a loved one. Instead agencies like the NHTSA, wish to promote silly, insulting, do nothing moves such as their attack on children.

"Crash-Typing Children (sic)

Studies argue that children lack the experience and cognitive ability to make accurate
judgments on various aspects of traffic safety, such as judging the speed of oncoming vehicles
and assessing whether it is safe to cross (Muttart, 1995). Foot et al., (1999) revealed that as
children age, they become more proficient in recognizing safety-relevant features in traffic
scenarios. Child pedestrians are at heightened risk in traffic because they are not able too
distinguish the sound and visual stimuli that are important to their safety (Foot, Tolmie, Thomson,
McLaren, &amp; Whelan, 1999)."

Since they lump all children into a single group this is useless. 

Also, in many ways, I feel that older children may or may not follow the laws as much as adults do. Children go through a stage where they become obsessed with rules, and I doubt that traffic rules are any different. Thus, it's supposition and leaping to conclusions.

This is the heart of my problem with the NHTSA's statements. They seem to be creating a massive snow screen, all of it geared to distract us from the basic fact that all this misery is caused by cars. Take them out of the equation and we won't need all this. Because this is true, it makes little sense to waste time blaming children for their own deaths.

On the other hand, as a study in the extremes that humans go to rationalize behavior that they know is wrong, the NHTSA is first rate.

"COUNTERMEAUSURES TO IMPROVE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY"

Guess which mode has little responsibility in this section. Sigh.

"Bicycling in the United States is both a popular recreational activity and a means of
transportation; however, bicycling can be risky."

Hmmm, with over 30,000 deaths a year, would state that motoring is risky?

"Results also pointed
out that housing characteristics, such as low median rent, a high proportion of poor residents and,
to a lesser degree, lower income, were correlated with higher crash rates. "

In the entire bicycle section they failed to consider that the vehicle speed had anything to do with the fatality and injury rate, though they talked about the types of bicycle ridden, helmets, and lots of other things that are correlated with only a small fraction of fatalities and injuries.

The entire section was obsessed with cyclists following traffic laws, but it did not ask the question as to why so many law abiding cyclists are dying nor did it question why, in many, many cases, it's perfectly legal to kill someone with their car.

They seem to think that compliance with law is equivalent to safety which is delusional.

If I were to grade this article, I'd give it an F. They didn't address any of the true causes of why pedestrians and cyclists die. If their recommendations are put into effect, it would lead to more harassment for cyclists and pedestrians, more tax money squandered and no new safety benefits.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So sickened I am by the totally incompetent wastes of space that the tax squandering NHTSA is, I'm going to do their job for them and actually write some decent policy. Too bad that, unlike them, I'm not getting paid for this or will anyone read this.

Background:

Despite the large number of pedestrians and cyclists killed by automobiles, government agencies, like the NHTSA take the immoral stance that we are all "equally" to blame for this situation. In reality, if you banned walking and bicycling, there would still be too many people dying inside of automobiles.

In this study, the NHTSA takes its twisted logic to a dark conclusion and begins to blame children, yes children, for their own deaths.

In order to show that there is a healthier, happier, and less expensive alternative to the madness that the NHTSA promotes, I will propose real world safety interventions which will actually work.

Objectives and methods:

I am going to rewrite the above paper using only proven methods to increase safety. I'll examine the specifics of the papers in another article.

Results:

General: We have known, for decades what works and what does not work but due to the fear of motorists' and due to seeking protection for themselves, government agencies go out of their way to absolve motoring for the death and destruction that it causes.

Epidemiology: In general, despite our knowledge, we ask the wrong questions. Some better questions we can ask is: was there proper infrastructure in the location that the collision occurred? If not, why not? If it is at night, did the motorist have their lights on? Were there street lights? What color was the automobile? What was the estimated speed as well as posted speed limit where the collision occurred?

Problem size: Since it's immoral to kill people with great frequency and regularity, getting the precise totals is a waste of time. It is worthwhile to determine where the worst areas are in order to work on those first, however.

Crash and injury causation: For nearly 100% of the crashes, one might say that the motorist was driving at such a high speed that she was not prepared to stop in a timely manner. Furthermore, we might note that the most likely reason for the severity of the injury is due to the great size and speed of the motor vehicle.

The next part was a glimmer of wisdom until I realized that it was, again, a way of getting motorists of the hook.

"Laws and enforcement.: Research shows that many traffic laws regulating the interaction
among drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians are ignored regularly. Some laws may not be known or
understood. Others may be ignored because they appear unnecessary. Enforcement is sporadic
and ineffective in improving behavior."

"The most obvious need is to establish a strategy regarding these laws and their
enforcement. One possibility is to accept the current situation and recognize that these laws
describe ideal behavior but will not be obeyed regularly. This strategy accepts that laws and
enforcement have little role in improving pedestrian and bicycle safety."

I would argue that enforcing most laws for pedestrians and cyclists is harassment as it does not increase safety, traffic level of service, nor maximize any other public good other to placate the irrational feelings of some people's notion of "fairness".

In a truly fair world, there wouldn't be any laws governing pedestrian behavior and cyclists would follow laws more as a courtesy to one another rather than as a way to avoid (in many people's minds) dying for minor infractions.

"A final possibility, intermediate between these extremes, is to concentrate on situations where conflicts are frequent, risks are high, and the public supports action, such as school zones and red light running."

I do think that we should focus on where laws actually impact lives. All of these pertain to motoring, only. I do not think that we should wait for public support because if the public supported the "right thing" then we wouldn't need laws and government. Look at red lights, for example. Many vocal people in the public are very much AGAINST enforcing red light running. This kills a lot of people, and thus, we should figure out what's "best practice" and not subject our public policy to a weak ass popularity contest where the most obnoxious and loudest contestant wins.

"Education and enforcement, aided by technology as appropriate, can be used to increase compliance."

Can it? I noticed that this paper promised to be a survey of other papers, but when the authors have a strong personal opinion, they have no problem putting it out there without reference. This is deceptive because their long bibliography gives the impression that the policy has been wholly established by research and this is not true. 

Public information and education: This stuff is mostly a waste of time, and mostly a blame game. Education does not make you immune to motorists hopping onto sidewalks and kill you like they do for 10% of the collisions in New York. Proper lane positioning will not protect you from a texting driver of an SUV. And following the laws on when to yield for stop signs and lights will not protect you from motorists who run them. These deaths are all too common and these things will only give people a false sense of pride and confidence with no real safety improvement. Finally, the very existence of these classes can be used to blame victims: if only they were more educated, they would not have died.

Let's teach the basics to children and move on with our lives. Walking and riding a bicycle, for the average child, is not as complicated as these stupid classes make them out to be.

Facilities and infrastructure: For some strange reasons, we continue to spend more money to expand motoring facilities and infrastructure, but we fail to provide even the basics for cycling and walking. Then we wonder why there are so many dead cyclists and pedestrians. Perhaps, if, for a year, we would spend equal amounts of money on all three groups, we could then circle back to see if any other interventions what so ever are necessary. I doubt it

Alcohol: Drinking alcohol is so stigmatized by the US government that just having traces of alcohol in anyone involved in an accident will stop the search for other causes of the accident. This, perhaps, has distorted the statistics and artificially inflated the dangers of alcohol. 

Mixing alcohol and heavy machinery should be discouraged. Driving drunk is rightfully penalized. However, when heavy machinery is removed, we run little risk to ourselves and others. Perhaps if we were not so in love with automobiles and judgmental of moderate alcohol consumption, we would not be so quick to blame the alcohol and excuse the machines.

About 90% of bicycle collisions do NOT have alcohol involved. Due to these facts, it would be crazy to say that riding sober if more risky. But to suggest that these facts suggest that alcohol makes cycling risky is begging the question.

Conspicuity: This is yet another field day for excusing motorists. If a motorist didn't' see a cyclist or pedestrian, we never stop to think if the motorist's eyes or bad, the motorist isn't up to the task of motoring, or perhaps we allow people to drive too fast. One standard for motoring should be that one should be prepared to stop at any time. If they hit someone it was because they were not paying attention or they were speeding.
 
There are many cars that I fail to see because they are black or gray. I suggest that all cars should have alternating dark and reflective stripes on them so that they can be seen in all lighting. It's unfair to make me wear a yellow vest while trying to avoid getting hit by almost invisible cars.

Older Pedestrians: Unfortunately, the fact that so many elderly people die shows how careless we are for our parents. The elderly and children are the canary in the coal mine. Things should be made safe enough so that even young children or confused elderly people can navigate their environment safety. Anything less would be cruel. The standard is a safe environment and not imprisoning a large part of our population.

Bicycle helmets: These are highly controversial. Again, they are critical for blame shifting of bad motoring practices and design onto cyclists. The research is an ink blot test in which just about any position can be validated by cherry picking studies. The one thing that is consistent with studies is that it has not been demonstrated that mandatory helmet laws increase the popularity of cycling, though the contrary has been demonstrated by several authors.

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Introduction:

"Starting with the Intermodal Surface
Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) that provided funding for pedestrian and bicycle
facilities, there was also a call for a national bicycling and walking study (Zegeer &amp; Feske,
1994). The TEA-21 highway authorization bill included bicycling and walking as INTEGRAL parts
of the nation's transportation system and made all major funding sources for Federal aid
transportation programs available to support bicycling and walking." [Emphasis mine.]

Wow, this is a sad, sad joke in San Diego. 1991 was TWENTY-TWO years ago. Perhaps like other words in legal terms, INTEGRAL, means something different than I think. In the context of what we have, integral, in context of cycling, seems to mean totally ignored except for singling out for harassment and blame.

"Spending on bicycle 
facilities grew from a few million dollars annually in 1990 to about $260 million annually in
2000 (Clarke, 2000a)."

Wow, I'm totally befuddled on where that money is going as there is literally NOTHING which is solely for cycling at all in San Diego. There are a few lanes which are used as shared space for unloading cars, cutting through to park, and to block for extra parking in a pinch. Paths, generally have large parking lots so that motorists can park there and stroll around for a few feet. Meanwhile, billions were spent on motoring only, freeways.

"This report makes use of 12 previously conducted comprehensive reviews of specific
pedestrian and bicycle areas, which together included over 1,150 studies:"

Wow, and they found all 1,150 studies which showed that yellow vests and helmets actually had a noticeable impact on pedestrian and ccyling safety? If so the studies were a total waste of time as five minutes of google showed that there was controversy in both areas.

The next statement should be bolded:

"Street design, location of services and facilities, and the person’s income has been shown
to influence pedestrian travel behavior."

Thus, the key to safety is design. 

"A report by Ernst (2004) suggests that high-speed arterials roads pose the most risk to
pedestrians. Based on NHTSA’s FARS data, this report shows that principal arterial roads
accounted for 31% of pedestrian fatalities, followed by local roads and expressways, which
accounted for 22 and 15% of pedestrian fatalities, respectively. Furthermore, over 40% of
pedestrian fatalities occurred in locations lacking crosswalks and the most risky areas were lower
density neighborhoods with large arterial streets and few crosswalks or sidewalks (Ernst, 2004)."

Thus, lower speed limits, more cross walks, and either creating alternate routes or greater separation of arterials from pedestrians are the cornerstones of pedestrian safety.

"A similar study conducted in San Francisco, California showed that pedestrian injuries were
more likely to occur in areas with greater traffic flow and greater population densities. "

RAISING THE SPEED LIMIT IS CONDEMNING PEOPLE TO DIE. 

Again, traffic calming seems to be the most obvious and most effective way to create a safer environment.

Thus, a great deal of money can be saved in immediately canceling all road widening projects as well as the building of freeway style on and off ramps on arterials in neighborhoods. In fact, since we know that arterials tend to be the only routes between neighborhoods, we should refrain from building them all together.

The money saved can  be used for traffic calming in roads which were designed back in the days that human life meant nothing in the obsession with moving cars at ever faster rates in order to attain meaningless "level of service" goals.

  <title>TRL Report PPR 580 FINDINGS: Infrastructure and Cyclist Safety: More VC Nonsense</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm continuing my love affair with the UK with my review of this report that recently crossed my desk:

TRL Report PPR 580 FINDINGS: Infrastructure and Cyclist Safety

"The Department for Transport commissioned TRL to conduct a literature review to consider the
role of infrastructure in relation to the safety of cyclists and their interaction with other road
users."

What could be more fun than a literature review?

Unfortunately, a review this is not because it has NO references. Not show a single reference and making assertions without a single citation is garbage level research.

Furthermore, their findings contradict some things that I have discovered in my own readings of the literature.

"Overall, it proved problematic to draw firm conclusions from the literature."

YES! If they had just stuck with this mantra, we'd be all good. Unfortunately, right after saying that it's hard to have conclusions, they start taking conclusions based on zero evidence, speculating, and making recommendations.

"Taken as a whole, the
most significant infrastructure-related risk factors for cyclists in single vehicle incidents on
highways appear to be slippery roads (due to weather) and poor or defective road surfaces."

I don't know the UK literature, but in the United States the biggest problem is speed of a cyclist. Is there a reason that they don't want to put this here? I can only speculate myself, but VCer do NOT talk about slowing down cyclists even though riding slowly and cautiously is the single most important thing one can do to be safe.

" For
multi-vehicle collisions, the main infrastructure risk factors appear to be posted speed limits and
encounters with other road users at junctions."

Yes to speed limits. I found this with Australian crash data, the only data that actually gave a table of posted speed limits correlated with fatalities and injuries.

Junctions? Yes and no. Again there are many, many collisions. The most deadly appear to be from behind. 

Vehicular cyclists like to sweep this risk under the rug because it would mean that infrastructure makes one safer (it does) and that vehicular cycling is dangerous and foolish (it is).

http://www.devon.gov.uk/cyclist_casualties_webpages.pdf

Depending on how you look at it junctions were 50% or less accidents. There's the urge of VCers to reclassify everything as a junction in order to get the stats up, but in the pie graph I linked to, 50% of collisions are not even near a junction. This is far from a literature review, but it shows how little work is required to disprove something which sounds good to those who have taken classes but is not supported by all the data.


Also, in the above data, collisions from the front of the bicycle were 51% which means that in almost half the cases, the cyclist was struck from either the sides or behind.

Plus, only 12% of cyclists were faulted. Thus, lane positioning or other types of voodoo would have not helped in 86% of the cases. 

Other literature shows that the impact speed at collisions tends to be less than that of mid-block which is because often motorists slow down or even stop at junctions; something that they seldom do mid-block.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/dec/15/cycling-bike-accidents-study

"The data, which was analysed by the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL), showed that more than a quarter of all cycling deaths in 2005-07 happened when a vehicle ran into the rear of a bike. This rose to more than one-third in rural areas and to 40% in collisions that took place away from junctions."

"Of all interventions to increase cycle safety, the greatest benefits come from reducing motor
vehicle speeds."

I agree 100% with this statement.

"Reducing the speed of
traffic through junctions appears to be an effective approach to reducing cycle casualties, and
physical calming methods are a reliable means of achieving such a reduction."

No. There are many treatments which are available, but this stupid paper doesn't list them. I wonder if "comprehensive" means "made up off the top of the head by the author" instead of "looking at wide variety of sources."

"Providing segregated networks may reduce risks to cyclists, although evidence suggests that the
points at which segregated networks intersect with highways can be relatively high-risk,
sometimes of sufficient magnitude to offset any safety benefits of removing cyclists from the
carriageway."

I never, ever saw evidence of this. Furthermore, cycle tracks are seldom made without follow up studies, treatments at junctions (which I personally consider to be PART OF INFRASTRUCTURE). SINCE MAKING JUNCTIONS SAFER IS PART OF INFRASTRUCTURE, IT MAKES NO SENSE TO SAY THAT INFRASTRUCTURE MAKES THINGS MORE DANGEROUS.

" A number of infrastructure interventions that are not widely used in the UK have been
implemented on the continent to increase safety at junctions."

YES! 

"Particular examples include cycle
lane markings continued across junctions, cycle pre-signals and Trixi mirrors (mounted below
signal heads to allow drivers of heavy vehicles to see cyclists at their nearside). The literature
suggests that, appropriately applied, the former two approaches can have a beneficial effect on
cycle casualties."

Yes, yes.

"Reducing the speed of traffic through junctions
appears to be an effective approach to reducing
cycle casualties. This can be achieved by side entry
treatments, raised cycle track crossings and
signalisation of large roundabouts, for all of which
there is evidence of a casualty reduction benefit for
cyclists. Traffic calming in general, including
features that reduce traffic speed through junctions,
such as raised tables, is likely to be of benefit to
cyclists, although care should be taken with some
features, such as road narrowings and the
placement of speed cushions, that they do not
increase conflict between cyclists and other road
users."

Great!

"Although speed reduction may provide benefits,
cyclist injuries involving heavy goods vehicles
(HGVs) at junctions were often found to take place
at low speed. This suggests that relative
positioning and visibility of the cyclist may be a
key factor in these incidents."

NO! Stopping mixing lorries with bicycles and getting better lorry drivers is the answers you are looking for. A SHITTY DRIVER CAN KILL SOMEONE IN A CANARY SUIT AS DEAD AS SOMEONE IN GOTH GETUP!

"Providing segregated networks may reduce risk to
cyclists in general, although evidence suggests that
the points at which segregated networks intersect
with highways can be relatively high-risk,
sometimes of sufficient magnitude to offset any
safety benefits of removing cyclists from the
carriageway. This may be particularly the case if
segregated networks remove cyclists from
relatively low-risk links but then increase their
exposure at junctions."

I have not seen any separated infrastructure that increased exposure to motor vehicles at junctions or otherwise. Note that, like other nonsensical assertions, there's not any reference here. This is purely speculative.

http://cottenhamcyclist.blogspot.com/p/stats.html

"3% of all collisions leading to deaths or serious injuries took place on bike lanes..."

Ah, the wonders of 5 minutes of google. :)

"Piecemeal implementation
of such an approach, however, is unlikely to be
satisfactory, and careful consideration needs to be
given as to the best sequence in which to introduce
measures."

I agree 100%. No network, no right to cycle, no cycling safety.

This study repeats the debunked notion that "facilities" make things more dangerous at junctions at least four times. There's some strange verbal tic going on here which has to be based in VCdom as it's not based in any facts I have seen. Overall, "cycling facilities" take junctions into account and thus, it's kind of stupid to say that "building facilities, which make junctions safer, will put cyclists at risk in junctions."

TRL Report PPR 580 another complete waste of government money promoting someone's personal agenda without regard for facts nor common sense.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[We often think that our morality is our only one, but there are many other forms of morality out there.

For example, in some pagan moralities, instead of protecting one's family at all costs, a king would kill his son if he felt it would help win a war.

Similarly, in our mostly Christian Nation, we are actually dominated by an unforgiving pagan style morality I call Motoring Morality.

Note that I strongly disagree with this--however, this is an accurate reflection of both how much these "safety" organizations protect us as well as how they classify and treat victims. (Spoiler: they punish them like scape goats).

Here are a few lessons from the NHTSA and others:

1. If you are walking and you are wearing dark colors at night, you deserve to die. No other questions asked.

2. If you are walking and you drank a little, you deserve to die. Better to drive.

3. If you ride a bicycle and you make a single traffic violation, you deserve death.

4. If you ride a bicycle, you are a thief, and society must somehow find a way of extorting the money you owe for the extremely expensive government road program even though the fact that the roads are so obscenely expensive is to make room for all the bulky cars.

5. Just like the pagans, children's deaths are most often blamed on the child if a motorist is involved. Thus, just like pagans would sacrifice their children to win wars, we sacrifice a few thousand people to the transportation gods even though making things safer is entirely possible. This is because of #6.

6. Whatever a motorist does is right: If you are in a car and you commit a crime, the state may not be able to stop you because it "violates your rights". If you are in a car, and many people commit the same crime such as running stop signs or speeding, enforcement and even the laws are changed to excuse the crimes and to make them legal again. 

7. If you travel by any other means than car, you are stupid because the state will do nothing to protect you or kill you. If you drive a car, and make a lot of mistakes, the state will bend over backwards to protect you by installing guard rails, cutting down trees so you don't crash into them, and mandating more safety standards so you are more likely to survive a collision.

8. "Roads are for cars." Motorists should no have any sense of personal responsibility. Instead of driving at a sane speed so they can stop for someone, possibly someone who is mentally impaired, from running in front of them, instead, they will clear out any non-motorized humans from the roads. If someone enters the roads outside of tiny designated areas, the law, which is too busy to ticket motorists, will punish them. If the law fails to punish them, a motorist will eventually kill them.

9. We take Motoring Morality as a law of the universe not as an arbitrary set of moral guidelines made mainly by motoring companies to make people feel good about their products killing so many people. If you mention Motoring Morality, even to agree with it, you will be branded a social outcast. 

Look on any forum online where they mention bicycles and you are sure to see one or more of these moral statements.

  <title>85% Reduction in Injuries and 88% Reduction in Head Injuries</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[LTRs know that the above title is a paraphrase from a paper I despise:

A case-control study of the effectiveness of bicycle safety helmets by Thompson, Rivara &amp; Thompson. New England Journal of Medicine 1989, Vol 320 No 21 p1361-7.

This is the single most cited paper in all the public agencies in the United States.

I personally think that the Thompson paper is either garbage or highly misrepresented--I'm not smart enough to know which--but I do feel that we need to prove Thompson wrong.

However, Thompson is a peer reviewed paper and that gives it a lot of weight with many people, including me until I looked further into it.

There is a lot of back and forth on whether the famous quotation means what people think it means:

"In regression analyses to control for age, sex, income, education, cycling experience, and the severity of the accident, we found that riders with helmets had an 85 percent reduction in their risk of head injury (odds ratio, 0.15; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.07 to 0.29) and an 88 percent reduction in their risk of brain injury (odds ratio, 0.12; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.04 to 0.40). We conclude that bicycle safety helmets are highly effective in preventing head injury."

Critics are often called idiots because we don't understand odds ratio. I don't know what that means.

But I do know this, I'll be $1000 to the first person responds that next time there's a new Mandatory Helmet Law, accounting for the changing population of cyclists, there will NOT be a 88% reduction in brain injury. No weaseling out this time. I don't care if people wear helmets or not. I'm saying that if there's a MHL in a state such as California, the next year, there will NOT be 88% less brain injuries in cyclists.

It's easy to quote papers and call people idiots, and in this case it's easy for me to make a thousand dollars. Yes, the Unbound household has a budget for extorting fools who believe in this nonsense.

There has been a lot of criticism to this paper. [http://www.cyclehelmets.org/1068.html]

"Numerous studies show that virtually all cyclist deaths and the vast majority of debilitating brain injuries are caused by collisions with motor vehicles. According to one source, not a single helmeted cyclist in the TRT89 study was in collision with a motor vehicle (Snell)."

Plus According to the law (below), the government should do a _comprehensive_ review of the literature. A comprehensive view shows that some studies show a strong safety effect for helmets including MHL, some studies show that helmets are useless, and some show that MHL actually increases risk to cyclists including head injuries.

"With respect to influential scientific information disseminated by the DOT organizations regarding analysis of risks to human health, safety, and the environment, DOT organizations will adopt, with respect to the analysis in question, quality principles of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1996 (42 U.S.C. 300g-1(b)(3)(A) &amp; (B), except where the agency adapts these principles to fit the needs and character of the analysis. These principles are as follows:

"Use the best available science and supporting studies conducted in accordance with sound and objective scientific practices, including peer-reviewed studies where available.

Use data collected by accepted methods or best available methods (if the reliability of the method and the nature of the decision justifies the use of the data).

In the dissemination of influential scientific information about risks, ensure that the presentation of information is comprehensive, informative, and understandable. In a document made available to the public, specify, to the extent practicable:

Each population addressed by any estimate of applicable effects.

The expected risk or central estimate of risk for the specific populations affected.

Each appropriate upper bound or lower-bound estimate of risk.

Each significant uncertainty identified in the process of the risk assessment and studies that would assist in reducing the uncertainty.

Any additional studies, including peer-reviewed studies, known to the agency that support, are directly relevant to, or fail to support the findings of the assessment and the methodology used to reconcile inconsistencies in the scientific data."

[http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/subject_areas/statistical_policy_and_research/data_quality_guidelines/html/guidelines.html]

That's a lot of verbiage. I think that the main point is that the NHTSA and the CDC should give both the lower bound and upper bound percent of people that they expect to be helped by helmets.

So the fact is that even among experts there's no consensus for whether helmets help at all. A conservative approach, in the lack of any consensus, is to not say anything at all on an issue or to acknowledge the lack of consensus.

Further more, I have been made aware of a list of things that good researchers and public policy organizations do NOT do:

"They do not eagerly seek out the highest possible figures in a series of statistics, independently of their reliability, or otherwise, simply because they want, for whatever reason, to maximize the figure in question, but rather, they assess all the available figures, as impartially as possible, in order to arrive at a number that will withstand the critical scrutiny of others." [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denialism]

So even if Thompson had a nice study, over 24 years ago, this single number should not be used to build all of public policy regarding helmets.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Bright Colors Save Lives</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[LTRs know that in principle, I'm against bottom up safety for cycling.

The AAA, on the other hand, is only for bottom up safety as they'd rather have some dead cyclists on their hands than to take an honest look at how much pain and misery their members are causing society.

Thus, the whole bright colors nonsense which is awesome because it's so hard to comply.

This is because most people intuitively realize that if the color of your shirt is your biggest danger and you are not in a gang then things are messed up.

This is why nobody buys a car and paints alternating light and dark florescent stripes on it. That's because they'd rather get into a wreck than drive a dork mobile.

To test this, I emailed the following to AAA:

"I have a problem when parallel parking on 50 MPH roads where I try to cross (there is no cross walk) and I almost get hit everyday because I can not see the black and gray cars.

I noticed that you suggest bright colors for cyclists:

http://newsroom.aaa.com/tag/bike-safety/

Since the roads are so deadly there are almost no cyclists on these roads. There are many cars.

Can you please recommend bright colors to motorists as well so we can get to and from our cars safely?

Can you please sponsor a bill which states that if a car is not brightly colored and it's hard to see then the one driving this car is automatically liable for the accident? Often dark clothing is given as a reason. I can see people walking on the street with my car because it has headlights, and I drive slowly enough to stop at any time.
Plus, pedestrians are slow. Cars literally come out of no where due to the dark colors even during the day.

The car below, for example, has a good mix of colors to be seen in any kind of daylight:

http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hBDTbuHXNrA/UOdXaZegP9I/AAAAAAAAHaU/AvEUHr7dy1Q/s1600/Nyestafferingerbil_politidk.jpg

I have tried to get them to slow the speed limit, but I have heard there's a law which prohibits this obvious safety precaution. 50 MPH roads and parallel parking do not mix!

Can you please propose a solution which still allows me to park near my gym, but not be faced with almost certain death, daily?

Certainly your organization is in favor of brightly colored cars and slower speed limits, both obvious solutions which will save many of your member's lives."

The response was:

"Dear Mr. Unbound,

Your email to Ms. Yolanda Cade, Managing Director, AAA Public Relations was received and referred to my attention. Thank you for sharing your concerns and ideas regarding cycling safety. Car buyers often ask, "What color car is safest?" Unfortunately, the relationship between car color and safety is not at all clear, because only two scientific investigations of the matter have been conducted to date, and the authors of both studies admitted that they were not able to draw clear or generalizable conclusions. The relationship between car color and safety is complex. Background color (trees, desert, etc.), weather conditions (rain, fog, snow),and daylight have a profound effect on conspicuity. In addition, any study of the relationship between car color and crashes must consider all confounding variables including age, sex, weather conditions, and the time of day that the crash occurred.

It's unfortunate that there isn't a safer solution for parking your vehicle when you visit your local gym. A good start may be to discuss the safety concern with your gym, and also with your local city planning department. Traffic Engineers are tasked with this solving these types of issues, but they often don't know about them, because they aren't reported. We suggest visiting the League of American Bicyclists website for more information on safety techniques for riding in the traffic situations your faced with daily. We welcome your feedback at any time and thank you again for sharing your thoughts.

http://www.bikeleague.org/programs/education/courses.php"

My response:

"Thank-you for your reply.

Knowing that a single color is not safe in all conditions, will you
please take down the advice to those of us trying to get to our cars
to wear bright colors?

As you said, the relationship between color and safety is not clear.

Does not advice to wear bright colors give us a false sense of
security? Shouldn't cyclists and pedestrians be advised that bright
colors have questionable if no benefit at all?

Finally, can you please advise the NHTSA and police reporting agencies
to stop using "dark clothing colors" as a "cause" for pedestrians and
cyclists being hit by automobiles?

I feel that for all modes, useless safety advice is worse than no advice at all."

I still have not gotten a reply.

Apparently the AAA is deliberately giving useless safety advice to cyclists and pedestrians which they know is so crazy that most people will not follow it. This way they can protect their members when they kill us. 

Cyclists, pedestrians, and yes, even motorists deserve better. 

Creating a system where there's a certain death for 30,000 plus people a year is wrong.

Boycott AAA until it puts out some real safety information such as slowing down cars, getting dangerous drivers off the road, and supporting safer infrastructure for all mode users.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Does the AAA Aid and Abet Manslaughter?</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2013/03/20/does-the-aaa-aid-and-abet-manslaughter/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Every year about 4,000 [http://www.wherethesidewalkstarts.com/2011/01/nhtsa-releases-2009-pedestrian.html] and about 600 [http://www.bicyclinginfo.org/facts/crash-facts.cfm] cyclists are killed.

Many of them die due to motorists running red lights. In fact, many researchers believe that this crime goes unpunished more often by not.

As big of a menace to the public as deadly motorists are those who encourage and protect them.

If someone encouraged someone to act negligently in another field, they would be called out for it and perhaps even punished.

The AAA, living the dream of Motoring Exceptionalism, goes unchallenged as they encourage illegal and often deadly behavior.

"There is growing outrage over the millions of dollars collected from red light camera tickets in the District. Now AAA is saying those cameras amount to a war on drivers."

[http://www.wjla.com/articles/2013/03/red-light-camera-tickets-bring-in-millions-86436.html]

I agree that the AAA has a duty to defend their members. But as a cycling advocate, I do not encourage law breaking. In fact I ALWAYS RECOMMEND COMPLYING WITH ALL LOCAL LAWS.

I'm not a lawyer, and this is not legal advice, but wikipedia can be a friend:

"(a) Whoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal.

(b) Whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if directly performed by him or another would be an offense against the United States, is punishable as a principal."

I love how the AAA manipulates the situation to make it look like the greedy government is robbing its citizens to pay its bills.

BUT MANY OF THESE MOTORISTS ARE KILLING PEOPLE. DO YOU REALLY THINK IT'S WISE TO DEFEND POTENTIAL KILLERS?

"It is necessary to show that the defendant has wilfully associated himself with the crime being committed, that he does, through his own act or omission, as he would do if he wished for a criminal venture to succeed.[4] Under this statute, anyone who aids or abets a crime may be charged directly with the crime, as if the charged had carried out the act himself.[5] This is distinct from the concept of being an accessory after the fact, a charge distinct from being a principal."

The AAA needs to be held accountable for its actions. Its members kill thousands of people a year in a system that they help to build then they turn around and defend those killers. For those of us who have not yet been killed or terrorized by law breakers; they make our lives a living hell.

The AAA should continue to push for their member's rights, but they should do so in a prudent and sensible fashion instead of taking the radical view that it's OK to break the law and not get punished.

Also, they really need to shut up about the "War On Motorists". Stopping manslaughter is not a "War". Every time they use such violent imagery, I think about the countless lives that are ruined for the friends and families for the victims that they defend and I wonder whom is really the victim of a war. 

YOU CAN'T KILL OVER 30,000 PEOPLE A YEAR, LOSE NOBODY FROM THE OTHER SIDE, AND WHINE THAT YOU ARE A VICTIM.

It reminds me of the kids that killed their parents then plead for mercy as they are orphans.

Contrast this to the cycling community which not only encourages legal cycling, but some members stop one another to verbally castigate law breakers. There are also classes which teach people to follow the law. Then there are the few law breaking cyclists who get the death penalty.

If there were different laws being broken and if they killed the same number of people, the AAA would be considered a terrorist organization.

I'm not saying that they are terrorists, but their members kill more people in the Continental United States.]]></content:encoded>

After having thought about this for a bit longer, I realize that the main reason is that e-bikes are not bicycles. They should not be called bicycles because bicycles are "human powered machines" and motorcycles are "motor powered machines."

Why do they say e-bicycle then?

I think that there are many reasons. One of them is that they feel that they can sell more in this category. After all, what would you rather have, a bad-ass bicycle or a wimpy motorcycle?

Also, over the years, bicycling has some cultural and symbolic capital in certain circles, and e-bikes would like to co-opt that without doing the actual work that got us there.

There's a certain amount of respect someone gets from climbing a hill due the effort and patience. E-cycling robs us of that sense of accomplishment while at the same time demanding the same amount of respect as if the e-cycle rider actually put out some effort.

Thus, in a sense, it's a fraud not unlike doping is in racing. 

When someone pedals past you on the road, you can admire that person. Imagine what happens when you realize that the person used a motor. You feel cheated.

Another reason that e-cycles suck is because the reasoning for using them is the exact same reasoning for motoring. If climbing a hill is too hard, let's put a motor on the bike! But if you are too weak to ride a bicycle why not drive a car? After all, isn't an e-bike just a Prius without walls? 

If you really want comfort, you probably don't like it too hot or too cold. A climate controlled car solves these problems as well.

Thus, the whole motivations of incompetance, laziness, and comfort seeking make a Prius more attractive than an e-bike which puts bicycles, in this value system, on the bottom of the food chain. Again!

In the cycling world, we are all ready shat on by motorists, and despite this, we are able to create a sense of beauty and joy due to our perseverance and strength, both inner and outer.

Now these douche bags, who are really motorists in Lycra, want to take this away from us, too?

Finally, if we permit e-bikes to ride on our trails why not have mopeds on bike lanes, too? And aren't mopeds smaller motorcycles? Why not invite them to the party? And now that we're spewing petrol, let's just cover ourself up from the elements. (Thanks Bike Snob). At the end of the day, why not do what a wise man once said, "Fuck it, I'm leasing a Hyundai." [http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2012/03/cycling-american-style-vehicular.html]

I don't "hate" e-bikes, but I do not think that they should be called bicycles any more than people like Lance should be called a champion cyclist. If you want to ride your bike faster up hills by doping or attaching hidden motors (yes they hide them because they are ashamed of using them) then do it. Just don't be an asshole and lie to the rest of us about it.

E-BIKES ARE NOT WELCOME ON OUR RIDES. YOU'RE NOT WELCOME IN THE CYCLING WORLD.

GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE TRAILS, BIKE LANES, AND BACK INTO YOUR SMUG, SELF-CENTERED MOTORING WORLD!

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[LTRs probably know that I try to examine all the pluses and minuses for infrastructure.

Over and over again, we hear the same, tired objections to cycling infrastructure.

I have learned a sales technique for this, but I'm sure that it won't work because objections are not real--they are confabulation, things people make up because they are in the closet cyclist haters.

The technique is to ask if anyone's objection is their final one. For example, if someone says that they are against cycling infrastructure because they don't want to spend "transportation money on someone's hobby", ask "is that your final objection."

If they say, "no" then they should put ALL their objections on the table. It's hard to satisfy someone who has an infinite, but secret well of objections. If we are to make a case, it's only fair that we can hear the COMPLETE other side.

Usually, what happens is that we get objections to infrastructure, then we meet them. For example, it's too expensive. We find the money and point out that this is a tiny, tiny fraction of the total transportation bill. The world's best infrastructure is literally pennies on the dollar compared to even a modest motoring program to say nothing of the gorilla sized projects that we have.

Next, they say that there is not enough room on the road. We find that room.

Now they think that it will put the city on the hook due to liability. We let them know that there is a level of legal immunity and that if the city is on the hook for a bike lane, are they not on the hook for lack there of? 

This can go on for ever.

The point is that we need the objections to be on the table and to be final.

The only sane objection I will object to is that people just plain out hate bicycles because it reminds them of liberals or nannies or kind people or some other group that they flat out hate. Or they had an altercation with someone on a bicycle and that's it for them, all cyclists must be exactly like that one person.

To this, the response is "one person one vote."]]></content:encoded>

  <title>How To Fix A Flat</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2013/03/31/how-to-fix-a-flat/</link>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the most annoying things in the cycling world is the fact that people have no clue on how to fix a flat. 

This is especially bad etiquette on a group ride.

Fixing a flat tire is an essential skill in being self sufficient. Many people do not know anyone who is good at fixing flats so they think it's a useless skill. Others tried to fix a flat, did a bad job, and then assumed that patches "don't work for a long term solution". These people are wrong. Patching makes a tire stronger than before. Patching can extend the life of a tire significantly.

Still, we have our Patch Nay Sayers. 

Often naysayers get around the whole notion of fixing a flat by bringing extra tubes. The problem is that extra tubes are expensive and they are wasteful. You can fix dozens of flats with the equivalent space and size of a patch kit to that of a single inner tube. 

So carry a patch kit, tire levers, tweezers, a pen, soap, water, a towel, talcum powder, and a pump. Make sure that the pump matches your tire which is presta vs. shraeder. 

Next, learn how to use the kit. If you follow all my instructions below you should be fine.

Finally, let those who know do. Often those who know is a girl. If you're a boy then please GET OUT OF THE WAY and let the girl do her job. Don't be sexist. Your dick won't get smaller for admitting that a woman can fix tires better than you. Also, BACK OFF. If someone is fixing a tire at a group ride give them ten or more feet and start a conversation, text, or read a book. Don't stare at the the fixer.

Also, you could have a slow leak. If you have time, try to blow the tire up and ride on that. If you can get a few miles this way, then this might get you home.

If not, here's how to fix.

First, feel the outside of the tire. Sometimes you can find metal or glass this way, best.

If you find something mark the spot with a pen. Then deflate the tire.

If you can't find it deflate the tire anyway.

Next take the tire off with the levers. At this point, you DON'T NEED TO TAKE THE WHEEL OFF.

If you are opening the back tire make sure you do this on the side which DOES NOT HAVE THE CASSETTE. As the cassette can puncture your tire.

Pull out the inner tube and make sure there's nothing poking it. Now inflate the tire. Use a normal pump and not the stupid CO2 pump. As you blow it up, feel around for the hole and also listen. If you still can't find the hole, you need to feel around on the inside of the tire for glass or metal. If you find it, match the inner tube's stem to the stem hole and you might be able to match where the glass came into the tire. If not, you might need to wet the small piece of soap and rub it around your inner tube. You'll see lots of bubbles when you find the leak. Don't be fooled by a few bubbles.

Finally, you have found the hole! Next wash the area around the hole. Then dry well with a towel. 

Now buff really well with the sander. You need to do a big area around the hole. A really big area.

Now deflate the tire. Find an appropriate size patch and use the tin foil backing as a model for how much rubber cement to add. You only need a thin layer but it has to cover 100% of the inside of the rectangle. Mine is usually slightly bigger than the actual tin foil, and I do a little on each side of the tire as well just to make sure.

Set a timer for ten minutes. YOU MUST WAIT A FULL TEN MINUTES. If you rush this part, you'll waste more time in the future.

After ten minutes take the backing off the patch. CAREFUL! If the patch folds in on itself, toss it. Now gently apply the patch WITHOUT FOLDING IT. IF YOU FOLD THE PATCH THEN PULL IT OFF AND START OVER WITH THE BUFFING PHASE, NEW GLUE, ETC.

Push really hard on the patch and especially smooth out the edges. Do not take off the clear plastic. 

Blow up the tire, slowly while pressing on the edges of the patch. IF PART OF THE PATCH DOES NOT STICK, PULL IT OFF AND START OVER.

Once the tire is partially inflated and it looks good, rub the patched area with talcum powder. Some people dump a little powder into their tire, too. This is a sound idea. If you skip this step your inner tube could stick to the tire and you'll get another flat and you'll be one of those fools who can't patch his tires because he doesn't think it works. Loser.

Now put inner tube back into the wheel. You probably didn't even have to take off the wheel! Once the deflated wheel is on and and the wheel is between the brakes where it should be, inflate. Done.

Now you are a step closer to self-sufficient and a step away from being a loser who forces his wife to sit by the phone to pick up up from his long ride. Forget all that. A cyclist can be _more_ reliable than a motorist if she knows how to fix a few things.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I know that this is a cliche, but the future for cycling in San Diego is moving so fast, I literally can not keep up.

While I did try to be the cutting edge, the most radical, Utopian, and insane of all advocates just like one of my heroes Eisenhower who created the interstate system:

"The cost of construction has been estimated at $425 billion (in 2006 dollars),[4] making it the "largest public works program since the Pyramids".[5]"

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_Highway_System

Wow, sounds kind of unbelievable, something that is never going to be built.

Oh, right, you ride on it all the time.

But at one time it was a dream.

Unfortunately, I no longer feel that I can dream big anymore.

Not because we have Quisling advocates who second guess all our decisions based on their phony degrees and person riding styles. (Though they do still exist.) Not because we have intractable political leaders who are cowardly. The second is not true. Our politicians have showed both courage and leadership, and they are a long cry away from the people I tried (and mostly failed) to interview a few years ago.

We have some of the best leaders in the country. We have money. We have the will.

The only problem is that my dreams are gone! I have to dream bigger.

This is the best problem to have! It's like choosing between two dream jobs.

I have a great deal of gratitude for those who worked so very hard both behind the scenes and in front of the cameras for our greatness.

Anyone who reads bike blogs or listens to the radio in San Diego knows that things are going very, very well.

My only fear is that the same Quisling who very publicly stab us in the back over and over again will NOT TAKE CREDIT FOR OUR SUCCESS. IF YOU DON'T HAVE SOME CRAZY VISION, EISENHOWER STYLE, THAT PEOPLE LAUGH AT YOU ARE NOT PART OF OUR SUCCESS.

IF YOU THINK THAT WE WILL GET LESS IF WE ASK FOR MORE, NEED TO MOVE CAREFULLY, OR THAT CHANGE WILL TAKE DECADES, YOU ARE NOT PART OF OUR SUCCESS. IF YOU'RE HERE TO MAKE FRIENDS, YOU ARE NOT PART OF OUR SUCCESS.

If you were balls out insane and thought up crazy ideas and pestered the city with them, then you are my hero. Thanks for the persistence, your time, for daring to piss people off, speaking the truth, bravery in the face of laughter and derision.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Equal Citizens</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[LTRs can skip...

One thing I like about the ever shifting VC/Cycling Savvy/New Flavor of the Week is the notion that cyclists are equal citizens.

This is so true which is why we need to get rid of the notion of "user fees" for road building.

This is why I am against the gas tax all together. I'm OK with a sales tax on petrol. But to put it as a "user fee" is wrong.

We are all citizens of the United States and we deserve equal protection under the government. In other words, though there are jokes that cyclists are "second class citizens" we aren't in law. There's nothing that says that cycling deserves less treatment when it comes to road building. In fact, we deserve preferential treatment in California.

"In 2006, the Legislature passed and Governor Schwarzenegger signed AB 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, which set the 2020 greenhouse gas emissions reduction goal into law."

http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/ab32/ab32.htm

We know under Smeed's law and others that this will preclude any new freeway widening. It implies that people should be nudged to bike, not forced or coerced like they were forced into cars by literal death threats--"if you ride a bicycle, you are taking your own life into your own hands".

This can be done by something as simple as closing down some roads or reallocating freeway money for cycling.

The point is that we all deserve the right to safe, convenient, and efficient mobility. There is absolutely no justification why the transportation budget does not give at least 33% of the money and real estate to active transportation. This reallocation of funds is both required by law and fair to all parties as it does not give cyclists an MORE money nor real estate than motor vehicles. Thus, we can stop the histrionic and childish "war on cars" nonsense. No, building good infrastructure is no a war, as wars kill people. Infrastructure saves lives and is the exact opposite of the effects of any war. 

Thus, we should stop using any notion of "user fees" as they make no sense for motorists nor for cyclists nor for pedestrians. Public transportation should be toll free just as roads are now and it should get a lot more funding as well.

To do any less would be to treat non-motorists as second class citizens which should require a constitutional amendment.

  <title>Save Our Parking: Revisiting SOHO</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Imagine a historic organization which totally ignores the dominant transportation forms at its time.

It's SOHO: Save Our Heritage Organization aka Save Our Property Values and Parking.

I am too tired to look it up, but there was a recent blogger who mentioned those people who are knee jerk against development are actually, predominantly, against losing parking and having to deal with increased congestion.

That's why the idea of good development is like the idea of a good disease. Asking what kind of development one wants is asking what kind of illness one wants to be infected with. The only answer is none.

But to ask for no development would make one a giant douche bag, a person who would not be taken seriously. 

Thus, there has to be a facade.

One facade, as per _Reluctant Metropolis_, is the "tract home environmentalist". They are those who were in favor of the freeway that cut through virgin woods. They were happy to buy a house built by a developer in a freshly exploited area. But they are opposed to the next person who wants to move in down the street because IT'S BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.

In the city, we don't have obscure species to protect. Thus, we need a new excuse to protect our parking spaces and our space on the road. Enter history!

I laugh at this as I was once tour guide for the buildings where the country was literally founded, in Philadelphia. The history of San Diego, is the history of whore houses. I don't mean this in a bad way: take the tour. Don't take my word for it.

SOHO cares little for actual history which is why they don't mention the proliferation of bicycles which occurred at the time when most of the buildings that they want to protect occurred. Their plan for Balboa Park was focused on building new roads! This does not go against their mission which primarily is focused on stopping all development projects.

"A 'teardown' refers to the practice of demolishing an existing house to make way for a dramatically large new home on the same lot."

http://sohosandiego.org/reflections/2003-2/histdistricts.htm

Note that this never happens. With small lots and tiny yards, this is physically impossible. Plus who wants a large new home with no space for their car nor a lawn. This is utter nonsense.

What SOHO hates are apartment complexes and other sky scrapers. This is because they are mainly suburbanites who believe that they need a car to buy a jug of milk. Thus, new apartment means more cars. This is probably true, but it's mainly so due the intense fight against spending any money to help alternative transportation. 

In general, they are unfamiliar with real cities so they see "urban" as bad. In fact, some people even use it for code for black person which is strange. 

Let's give SOHO a real history lesson. History is about our connection to the stories of the past and it's not to be abused by selfish property owners who fight against positive change. Let's not focus so much on our own Disney version of history--where everyone has their own motor car (sic)--that we disallow more history to happen.

History has to live and breathe. Bicycles are our past and our future. As SOHO says,

"A historical district is not a static museum, but rather a living, changing neighborhood."

New, transit oriented and cycling oriented housing is to be celebrated and not a "disturbing trend" as the selfish and short sighted SOHO says that it is.

  <title>Reconciliation?</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Lately, I have been wondering it it's possible for reconciliation between infrastructurists and vehicular cyclists (I'm not going to waste time on all of their guises from now on so when I say VC, I mean Savvy Cycling, and so on. Basically, anyone who if for classes and treating bicycles as motor vehicles, is VC).

This came about due to a friend of mine who is highly intelligent, and yet considered himself VC while at the same time, he was open for bicycling infrastructure.

This made me realize that there was a HUGE communication failure on my part.

I have always felt that it was blindingly obvious that the two positions were polar opposites. It was like talking about purple smells or toothpaste that tastes like D minor. The two just don't go together.

To paraphrase, as we are in the middle of the lane having this conversation, "What are we doing now?"

And that was the point: it would be nice to have cycle tracks everywhere, but for now, we should learn how to ride in the conditions that we are given. After all, it is how I live my own life. What could be simpler?

To sum it up, there are two belief systems in cycling advocacy. Savvy cyclists do a nice job at breaking down the differences, but they are so harsh in describing infrastructurists point of view, I feel that they have not demonstrated that they totally grasp our position.

First, I'll explain the Vehicular Cycling position.

People are rational, intelligent, and moral beings. There are norms that our society has and if we are brought up right or "educated", we will act in the proper way.

This view leads to talk of stricter enforcement both for cycling past stop signs and running over cyclists with Hummers. It leads to an obsession with "fault" as if there is one identifiable cause behind something so complex as a traffic collision. It leads to talk of overcoming fears and changing one's mindset. There are smart people and stupid people as well as good people and bad people in this universe.

Sounds good.

However, studies show that humans are, for the most part, good or bad depending upon the situation.  There are scientfic studies which prove this. This makes sense because we need to survive, and sometimes it's better to be good and sometimes it's better to violate some social norms. We have also learned that whether people are good or bad and whether they do something as pay attention while motoring has a lot to do with their environment. I thought that this was super obvious, but IF YOU BELIEVE VC PHILOSOPHY THEN THIS CAN NOT BE TRUE. If you can change your mindset or resolve to be a good person, you should automatically do the right always. There would be few traffic collisions because we always pay attention all the time. 

There are many sources for this belief. A great start is _Predictably Irrational_ [http://www.amazon.com/Predictably-Irrational-Revised-Expanded-Edition/dp/0061353248].

"Dan Ariely refutes the common assumption that we behave in fundamentally rational ways. From drinking coffee to losing weight, from buying a car to choosing a romantic partner, we consistently overpay, underestimate, and procrastinate. Yet these misguided behaviors are neither random nor senseless. They're systematic and predictable—making us predictably irrational."

The key part of this is that though humans are irrational, much of this can be predicated. This is the basis of traffic calming which among other things relies on motorists driving slower on narrower roads. 

Knowing this also allows us to realize that if one builds infrastructure then people will ride on it. This is the core tenant to infrastructurism: no infrastructure no right to cycle.

The fact is that cycling is legal on all surface streets yet it's less popular than illegal drugs. Why is this?

It's because cycling is uncomfortable. That's not a rational thing to say. Who cares about comfort?

Pretty much everyone which is why we sleep in beds and drive cars places and sit on couches. In fact, if one could pick a slightly higher risk with a payout of massively more comfort, we'd jump on that.

Another tenant of infrastucturism is that the main reason that people don't feel comfortable riding their bicycles is because they don't like to mix with high speed traffic. This is because most people have a belief that the most likely thing to kill them is a high speed car.

Studies show that this belief that people have is true.

This leads to another difference between VC and infrastructurism. (Let's just call it the Big I.) The Big I believes that people's emotions are good and normal. We believe that people should be rewarded for their natural behaviors. All of this requires tailoring the environment to the human being rather than recreating a human being around surviving around machines.

The way that every other hazard known to humans is treated this way except for motoring traffic. Smelting steel is done behind closed doors and only certain people are allowed on the factory floor. You don't have office workers walking past molten steel on their way to lunch and then blame them for burned because they didn't follow an esoteric rule nor would you comment on their black clothes nor anything else. And the helmets and other equipment would actually protect a worked in the case of an accident unlike a flimsy bicycle helmet which is useless in a high speed motoring collision.

A good example of how we should deal with machine is the iPhone vs. the punch card computer. In the 70's computer scientists didn't think that normal people should use computers because they were too stupid to do so. They wanted to teach programming in schools so we'd all become programmers. They went on to design languages so that business people could simply talk to computers like COBOL. Anyone know COBOL? How about those people who use an iPhone. Know any of these people? How do they use their phone? They just figured it out.

The streets should be like an iPhone. You should be able to figure it out. If you think that a certain feature means to ride in a certain way, you should be right more often than not. This is called the Princliple of Least Surprise, another tenant in the Big I.

So let the VCers teach punch cards and insist that we should all adust our clothing, our way of thinking, and our lifestyle so other people can ride in comforable machines.

At the same time, the Big I is created quieter, safer, more efficient, and more fiscally prudent environments all around the world.

When both sides are done, one will have knowledge of punch card technology and COBOL. The rest of us will be enjoying our iPhones.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>My Response to The Red</title>
  <link>http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com/2013/04/10/my-response-to-the-red/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Thanks for the feedback. Quite useful.

"I fear the COBOL reference might be playing to a limited audience, although I guess there is something fitting to that."

The point is that not only does nobody use COBOL, but nobody even knows what it is! Likewise, nobody in Southern California thinks that a bicycle is a mode of transporation. Look at the advocates. Most cycling advocates drive everywhere. Most pedestrians advocates drive everywhere.

There's a gated community that is being greenwashed as "pedestrian friendly". Haha.

http://www.onepaseo.com/
"I really like one thing that might have been expanded more: You basically led up to the idea that cycling with traffic can be seen as a predecessor to proper cycling development."

I actually do not agree with this at all. In fact, I think it's the opposite. There's a LOUD (online) VC advocate who recently taught his daughter to ride. Where did he teach her? Did he have her roll down Fairmount? No. He put her in an alley where there was little to no vehicular traffic. Likewise, I think that most people who learn to ride, do so on protected or traffic calmed areas.

An example is the Danes. They did just fine in San Diego. They hated it and thought it was regressive and that if they lived here, they'd buy cars. Yet their sweet infrastructure did not hinder them from learning to ride in San Diego.

"It is something we touched on in conversation the other day. While you don't necessarily cater to "cyclists" with infrastructure improvements, the presence of those cyclists helps increase mindshare about bikes and their place in society. How do we then balance that kind of mindshare with a message that is more applicable with the population on a whole?"

The cycling community is very small and insular. We don't really understand how the world sees us. Interviews in DC have shown that most legislators don't hate bicycles. This is especially true in SD. People like bikes.

There are other barriers both here and in other places than dislike of bicycles. We tend to think of people hating bicycles because the majority of interactions socially, on the road, and online with non-cyclists are negative. Anti-cyclists are very loud, but a tiny minority. Over fifty percent, in some surveys, of people want to ride some of the time but are afraid.

"There is one thing about the "anti-VC" argument that falls flat to me, however. Even if we get nice, fully separated bike routes along major corridors, we are likely to be living with shared streets for a very long time (if not forever) on side streets and residential streets. Those last 100-500 feet of travel will work more smoothly for all involved if people on bikes have at least a basic understanding of how to safely ride on a street with parallel parked cars and potentially other vehicular traffic."

In Copenhagen there are such streets you spoke of. But it didn't take special training nor experience to figure it out. You just took the lane and rode your bike. Speed limits were less than 15 MPH (don't recall the number). Even if there's an collision, this would be non-serious, most likely.

We had people tell legistators, for 40 years that we didn't need infrastructure because we can use existing facilities. Mode share is smaller now than it was then! There is no city in the world where 40% of the population vehicular cycles. If there was then I agree that we would not need facilities. All the places which have high mode share have nice infrastructure. The more time and space spent on infrastructure, the higher the mode share. No other variable has a higher correlation. We could say that facilities are the limiting reagent in the cycling reaction. Yes, the reaction runs faster with other catalysts, but facilities overwhelm all other variables.

"It kind of comes down to the same argument as before. I want infrastructure, but I don't think I should have to disdain skills that help me in the mean time to get it."

Do you consider me to be a "vehicular cyclist"? Very curious on this one.

Also, I don't disdain anyone's skills. In fact, I don't presume to tell anyone how to ride their bicycle. I have done research on behavior, but that's for another day. The point is that I feel that the way that people, especially intelligent people like you, ride is up to you.

The VC notion is that there's one right way to ride which can be found in the experiences of other cyclists. My point is that data and research should dictate best practices and that one's personal experience is a study where n=1.

Second, there's a bit of confusion on terminology here. There's a style of riding that I guess you call vehicular cycling and there's a mode of advocacy called vehicular cycling.

When I say VC, I'm only talking about the second one.

VC advocacy does not increase modeshare. In fact, Forester does NOT want to do this! He dismisses this goal as a "popularity contest".

VC advocacy is about blocking infrastructure, increasing penalties on cyclists who do not ride VC, and getting people to take classes so that they are "educated".

With this mindset, if you did not take a class and you get hit by a car, it's your fault.

Sounds kind of harsh to me, but this is precisely what they say.

I believe in sustainable safety.

http://bicycledutch.wordpress.com/2012/01/02/sustainable-safety/

Note that in road design ther's almost no consideration of safety especially to non-motorists. This is why the NHTSA and the AAA pushes for helmets, safety classes, and bright orange vests. Anything that does not admit that high speed traffic is the problem and pushes all the responsibility for dangerous road conditions and dangerous motorists onto cyclists and pedestrians. This is why we push back so hard against these things.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I know I'm going to hell for this! :)

Below is a series of emails on the CABO mailing list.

But first here's a photo of some of the better known vehicular cyclists:

They recently had a conference but didn't invite me! I would have gone as an "online journalist". Haha.

Can all those parties who are arguing PLEASE be respectful of each other?

There have been some excellent comments posted here by John Forester, Dan
Gutierrez, and numerous others.

I really don't care about who's right on what I consider hair-splitting.

I would appreciate it if people could be respectful of each other when
discussing these issues on this list.

All of the above have contributed greatly...and it would be nice if we
could all respect each other.

Thanks!

This is not hair-splitting; the discussion concerns the characteristics
of leadership, good and bad, which is of great importance to the welfare
of CABO. It is also of great importance to the welfare of the new
organization being created under the slogan of I Am Traffic. Less than
two months ago, in the email discussions of that group, Gutierrez was
involved in a very similar exchange concerning the meaning of the words
that he had written, which resulted in his public expressions of anger
such as we have read in the CABO list. When I suggested to him that we
conduct a private examination of the grammar of his sentence, to show
that the meaning transmitted to other readers was not what he had
intended (giving him the benefit of the doubt about motive), he
haughtily and publicly, refused.

In this discussion, I informed Gutierrez that "It has been commonly
argued in many places for many years that these exceptions were enacted
for the benefit of cyclists." His immediate reply was: "What does this
have to do with me?" I was obviously making no claim that he was
responsible for making that argument. But he should have known that his
unqualified statement that these exceptions were written by [bicycle]
advocates provides ammunition for those making that argument. Any leader
of an organization with a controversial agenda (as both CABO and I Am
Traffic are) needs to understand the social milieu in which that
organization has to operate, and to compose his statements so that they
both reflect his views and prevent misleading interpretations by others.
Gutierez's forceful defense of his statement: "Au contraire, the words I
originally wrote were factually correct.  Advocates did add the words,"
again shows that he fails to understand the difference between specific
accuracy and the social context in which those words operate.

I repeat: this is not hairsplitting. It is discussing the
characteristics required for good leadership of an organization that has
to operate in a context that makes it controversial. In that respect,
Gutierrez's words and actions give him a failing grade.

John,
I simply don't care what you think.  That you imagine yourself as an arbiter
or judge of leadership and social skills is fascinating from a purely
psychological standpoint, given your long history of alienation and
polarization within the bicycling advocacy community and your single handed
poisoning of the term "vehicular cycling", but none of makes any difference
to me.  That you see my disagreement as anger which justifies personal
attacks from you is simply a tantrum on your part and a rather poor attempt
at character assassination.  I will be adding your email to my delete list,
since you've made it clear that you seek to smear, and I've had my lifetime
fill of your personal invective.  This is the last time I will respond to
you on the CABO Forum list.

I agree with John.

I have met Dan.  A leader listens and takes notes about ideas.  Some are
great, some are so-so, and some don't work.  That is being a team member and
a team leader.

Dan listens and then corrects your grammar.  Notes are never taken.

This is not a leader.  This is a dictator.  I, too, give Dan a failing grade
as a leader. - Frank

Dan,

You accuse John of "personal invective".  Who is more at that than YOU?!  If
there is a poster child for "invective', your picture would be there.  You
are the Prince of "Invective" (and I am using your word here and there is no
way you can dispute that you used that word.).  There is no person better at
"invective" than Dan Gutierrez.

Your mind is sharp and your tongue is sharp.  Your ability to be the
leadership of CABO is severely lacking.

When you tell a long standing member of CABO that you "simply don't care"
about his opinion, you are deferring long standing standards to your own
means.

I "simply don't care" about you (your words and quoted).  You are CABO
baggage and will cause the end of CABO.

Is that your mission.  If so, you are doing a fine job.

I am jumping to "I am Traffic" and I hope you will not do this.

I like them.  We really do not need a bully in this, which is what you are.

Have a nice life and good luck to what you think you are adding to
bicycling, although you are sadly misdirected in your efforts.

You are a piece of Work (I substituted Work for what I was thinking that
starts with "S".)

I am done with CABO.  You put the lid on it for me.

I have other and more positive Forums to be part of.

I am for the positive part of cycling and forwarding it to the Cities that I
deal with. - Frank

Paul,

You're absolutely right, although I feel that John was perfectly in the clear for defending himself. He showed great restraint in not calling Dan an ass, as much as he may have felt like it. That guy can block all of us from his discussion if he chooses, because when the debate gets too warm for him to handle, that's exactly what happens.

  <title>What is CEQA?</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[http://ceres.ca.gov/ceqa/more/faq.html

CEQA, or the California Environmental Quality Act, is a statute that requires state and local agencies to identify the significant environmental impacts of their actions and to avoid or mitigate those impacts, if feasible.

In my words this is a good idea which has been built into a terrible law. I don't think we should get rid of the law, but it needs to be reformed.

Apparantly there's a LOS (level of service) for CEQA:

"Ironically, environmental quality considerations, in the form of California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) findings, are often the biggest obstacles to making quality-of-life improvements to city streets, not because pedestrian and bicycle safety improvements contribute to air / noise / water pollution (they don't), but because taking pavement away from private motorcars can potentially diminish the "Level of Service" (LOS) experienced by auto drivers below a failing-grade threshold of convenience."

"Level-of-Service A can describe free-flow operations. Traffic flows at or above the posted speed limit and all motorists have complete mobility between lanes." [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_service#Level-of-Service_in_North_America]

Yes, the state of CA seems to be insane enough to have determined that REDUCING TRAFFIC SPEED IS A NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT! Apparently, speeding cars are good for the environment.

Like it or not, this is the law, right now.

There are attempts to reform this stupid law:

"This bill would, until January 1, 2018, exempt from CEQA the restriping of streets and highways for bicycle lanes in an urbanized area that is consistent with a prepared bicycle transportation plan." [http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201120120AB2245]

The fact that this is even a notion to begin with shows how utterly asleep at the wheel our silly Quislings have been.

While they pontificated about how far we need to be from the side of the road, the government was redefining negative impacts to walking and cycling as good for the environment.

There is much, much more to this massive and complex law, but this is the tip of the iceberg on why this law needs to be reformed. It also demonstrates how auto-centricity corrupts even the best of laws. Finally, it also shows how raising the flag of environmentalism can be used as a ploy to bicycle haters (you know who you are) to squash infrastructure for cyclists.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/san-diego-bicyclist-forum/EdiJZ5UTNiQ

"To review: A construction project in La Jolla on Torrey Pines Rd between Prospect Place and Princess St/Hillside Drive has caused typical removal of bike lanes and traffic lane narrowing. A woman emailed the city complaining that while bicycling there cars bore down on her, and requested signage telling cyclists to use the sidewalk. Only one side of the road has a sidewalk, the sidewalk is unusually narrow, is full of hazards, including poles and driveways, and... it's a sidewalk. Never-the-less, the city complied and installed signs telling cyclists to use the one narrow sidewalk in both directions. I couldn't believe. The sign pictured below says:

BIKE LANE
CLOSED
DISMOUNT
CROSS
AND USE
SIDEWALK

Last week the City seemed receptive on the phone to my suggestion that they replace their illegal regulatory sign with a standard BMUFL sign, but today I received a disturbing email reply. I'm copying the whole thing below, but essentially they're saying they did this to avoid posting an MUTCD R5-6 ("NO BICYCLES") sign, because they had no other option.

The normal posted speed limit here is 35 mph, but through the construction zone it's 25 mph.
Below the copy of their "findings", is a draft response from me. Any comments, suggestions, corrections? Thanks!"

My response:

Another idea is that the city could allow advocates to build a better sidewalk.

They want 2 way traffic on a narrow sidewalk. That does sound stupid and dangerous. The sidewalk sounds old. The city is beyond broke (in their words) for bicycles.

Why not let the city get out of the way and accept a "donation" of a cycle track?

They were going to remake the entire Balboa Park in Jacob's image around a few parking spaces. Why not take a smaller check (free materials and labor) to let the sidewalk be fixed? The cycle track could be proof of concept.

Plus, the city all ready faces "liability" for having dangerous and inadequate facilities.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Tyrrany of the Majority Cycling</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority

"The phrase "tyranny of the majority" (or "tyranny of the masses"), used in discussing systems of democracy and majority rule, envisions a scenario in which decisions made by a majority place its interests so far above those of an individual or minority group as to constitute active oppression, comparable to that of tyrants and despots."

I don't know if this applies to cycling: making the world a living hell and kill a few hundred people a year, but I personally think that it applies.

"Ayn Rand, Objectivist philosopher and novelist, wrote against such tyranny, saying that individual rights are not subject to a public vote, and that the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from oppression by majorities (and that the smallest minority on earth is the individual)."

Thus, I don't think that any serious conservative especially the Randian should be against bike lanes and bicycle parking. After all, as I said before, bicycle infrastructure is the state's way of conferring both protection and legitimacy to cycling. Thus, no infrastructure, no right to cycle. Which means that no bicycle infrastructure is a form of Motoring Tyrrany.

Here's some criticism:

"Narrow groups, especially those who can reward active participation to their group goals, might therefore be able to dominate or distort political process, a process studied in public choice theory."

Yes! This is our dream. Dominate the political process and in the process save lives, create quieter communities, and happier people. Tyrrany of the safe and healthy!

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I continue to read this case study from 1972, and it's like a time machine to back when people were sane. If you talk to young children, you get a sense of fairness. But soon, I think we are bombarded by such right wing dogma, pseudoscience, aspirational TV, narcissistic spirituality, and other kinds of nonsense which warps our sense of reality. It seems that in the early 70's there was less of this insanity.

Like when I read sustainable safety literature, I get a deep sense of clear headed reason. To me, it's very comforting and calming.

This is unlike most cycling news I read these days, even from people whom I agree with, where I get a sense of anxiety and discomfort. I have read that the use of fear laden words sky rocketed somewhere around 1980. I believe this.

Not that I would know. I'm not a lawyer. I'm sure that things have changed over time, and I'm not sure how much this applies to now. Thus, I call this time period "CEQA: The Early Years."

http://ceres.ca.gov/ceqa/cases/1972/f_o_mammoth_092172.html

"Once a particular legislative intent has been ascertained, it must be given effect "'even though it may not be consistent with the strict letter of the statute.'" (Dickey v. Raisin Proration Zone No. 1 (1944) 24 Cal.2d 796, 802 [151 P.2d 505, 157 A.L.R. 324].) As we stated nearly a half century ago in In re Haines (1925) 195 Cal. 605, 613 [234 P. 883]: "'The mere literal construction of a section in a statute ought not to prevail if it is opposed to the intention of the legislature apparent by the statute; and if the words are sufficiently flexible to admit of some other construction it is to be adopted to effectuate that intention. The intent prevails over the letter, and the letter will, if possible, be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.'"

The intent of CEQA is to help the environment. Getting more people cycling will help the environment. Thus the intent of CEQA is to INCREASE CYCLING. Anything cycling infrastructure, that follows all other regulations, should be except from CEQA.

This is really common sense.

People who say otherwise either don't have a clue or don't like bicycles. It's as simple as that.

To stop traffic calming and the building of pedestrian and cycling facilities due to CEQA renders the actual law meaningless. Again, since this is so obvious, I believe that this is the intent of those who seek to abuse this law. I am speculating, but I feel that people must get a malicious thrill by damaging the environment by using the law intended to protect the environment.

Next, we deal with the fact that cycling infrastructure can be built only if environmental impact reports are filed. However,

"The use of these [environmental impact] reports by the planning agencies mentioned in Government Code section 65402 is secondary to the principal purpose of section 21151, which is to compel local governments to study and record the environmental implications of proposed activities before they are acted upon. This broad purpose cannot be frustrated by procedural details surrounding filing of the reports."

Thus, the benefit that people cycling gives to the environment should not be frustrated by extra paper work. There's no way someone who wrote this law would agree with that.

Another reason that environmental impart reports [EIRS] are not necessary is because cycling does not significantly negatively harm the enivornment. In fact, it helps the environment when people do it in lie of motoring.

Again, the older court agrees:

""We emphasize that by the terms of the act an environmental impact report is required only for a project "which may have a significant effect on the environment"

Also, in the "early CEQA years" they did not expect EVERY SINGLE BIKE LANE TO GO BEFORE CEQA:

"For the reasons given above, however, we expect that the majority of the private projects for which governmental approval will be sought in the future will present no risk of significant environmental effect and therefore will not require impact reports in any event."

I know this says private project, but I think that they meant that this would apply to government projects as well in light of the court's interpretation of the words "significant effect to the environment."
