CEQA II: The Sequel

One of the underlying narratives we hear in the environmental movement is that development hurts the environment. Thus development is bad. This should be a no brainer.

Unfortunately, this is not totally true as there are many, many different types of development.

When the issue of bike lanes come up, we all fall into this trap: those for and against them. This limited way of thinking is putting the skids to many cycling infrastructure projects in California as is the designation of a bike lane as "CEQA projects".

Since bicycling for transportation is good for the environment, it should be obvious that environmental law should encourage and not discourage infrastructure that makes cycling possible. Since this is not the case, people are being stupid or dishonest or both.

The fact that San Diego developed as it did, in my opinion after CEQA was passed shows how creative and against the original legislative intent that the law was and still is being interpreted:

Justice Stewart wrote for the majority: "Aesthetic and environmental well-being, like economic well-being, are important ingredients of the quality of life in our society, and the fact that particular environmental interests are shared by the many rather than the few does not make them less deserving of legal protection through the judicial process." (405 U.S. at p. 734 [31 L.Ed.2d at p. 643, 92 S.Ct. at p. 1366].) I

Bicycle infrastruce does enhance our well being especially when build in an area in which nature has been eradicated. Thus, I do not think that an honest and well meaning person would interpret CEQA to prohibit simple things such as intersection redesign.

Five years ago Justice Douglas spoke for the high court in admonishing the Federal Power Commission that the issue is not "whether the project will be beneficial to the licensee . . . . The test is whether the project will be in the public interest . . . in preserving reaches of wild rivers and wilderness areas . . . and the protection of wildlife." (Udall v. FPC (1967) 387 U.S. 428, 450 [18 L.Ed.2d 869, 883, 87 S.Ct. 1712].)

This shows that the main intention of CEQA is the preservartion of open spaces. I don't see what striping a bike lane has to do with destorying open spaces.CEQA II: The Sequel
