\chapter{Need for this Book}

I am writing this book because there seems to be a lack of a good manual for cycling in 
modern times.

There have been books written for the Dark Ages of cycling, but there are few
resources for the modern infrastructure that's being built. 

Also, there seems to be an overly obsession with negativity that dominates modern cycling classes.

Finally, there's even an anti-infrastructure bias to a lot of current training classes and even an anti-cycling bias.

Where's the cycling love?

It's right here in this book.
