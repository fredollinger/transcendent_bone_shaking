\section{Overview}

Vehicular Cycling is a bicycling philosophy which purports to be the "safest" way to ride.

This is based upon the results of a two part study done by Ken Cross in the 1970's.

It's mantra is that "Cyclists fare best when they act like and are treated like drivers of vehicles."

Though their catch phrase sounds slightly stupid, we'll see that in practice, calling them stupid is an act of kindness. In fact, VC followers have done more damage to cycling than any other group. 

This is because of their selfish desire to mix with traffic which has denied thousands if not millions the benefits of cycling. It has also resulted in making road conditions much more hazardous for cyclists, and it has fanned the hatred of motorists for cyclists.

The most embarassing part of vehicluar cycling is that most VC riders don't ride often. In fact, their founder, Mr. Forrester has been quoted as saying that bicycles are inferior to motorised vehicles.

VC followers have been known to bully anyone who disagrees with them with name calling and worse. They pose as experts in trials and to governments even though they have no special credentials and they have done no novel research on cycling. They pretend to be the sole custodians of cyclig knowledge even though most of their "knowledge" is opinion and much of it flies in the face of common sense, logic, everyday experience, and even the sole study that they base their riding style on.
